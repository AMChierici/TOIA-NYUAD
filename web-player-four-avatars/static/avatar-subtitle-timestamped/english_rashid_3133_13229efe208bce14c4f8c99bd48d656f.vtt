"The Student Government is the voice of students within the NYUAD community. 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
It serves and is ultimately accountable to the student body, upholding students' 

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
rights, promoting their welfare, and pledging to remain transparent and accessible to 

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
all students."

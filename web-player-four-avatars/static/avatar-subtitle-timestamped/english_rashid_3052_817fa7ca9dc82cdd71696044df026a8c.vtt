"Abu Dhabi is considered conservative but tolerant when it comes to dress 

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
code. Given the diverse nature of the population, one can see many 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
different types of dress in Abu Dhabi (jeans, saris, business suits, dishdashas, 

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
and abayas). Visitors are free to wear the same clothes that they 

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
would wear at home, but both men and women typically refrain from 

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
wearing excessively revealing clothing out of respect for the local culture and 

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
customs. For most of the year, lightweight summer clothing is suitable. Warmer 

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
clothes are needed during the winter months, especially in the evening."

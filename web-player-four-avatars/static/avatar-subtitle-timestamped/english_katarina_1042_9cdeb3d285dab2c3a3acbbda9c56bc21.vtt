The Emirate of Abu Dhabi holds 9 percent of the world's proven 

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
oil reserves and almost 5 percent of the world's proven supplies of 

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
natural gas. However, the government of Abu Dhabi is overseeing an ambitious 

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
strategy to diversify the local economy over the next two to three 

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
decades to ensure that the emirate continues to grow in a balanced 

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
and sustainable way.

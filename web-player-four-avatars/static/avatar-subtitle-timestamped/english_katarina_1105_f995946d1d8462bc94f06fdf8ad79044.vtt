NYU is fully committed to the well-being of our students, and we 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
will do everything we can to make sure a student's experience is 

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
both academically and socially fulfilling. However, should a student decide that the 

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
campus at which they matriculate is not the right fit for him 

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
or her, a request for a change of campus will be given 

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
consideration. If a request for change of campus is approved, the Financial 

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Aid office will evaluate a student's financial circumstances in the context of 

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
financial aid packages offered at the new campus. Financial aid packages vary 

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
greatly among our three campuses, so students should be aware of this 

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
reality should transferring become a consideration.

NYU Abu Dhabi encourages students to present their best case for consideration 

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
for admission. We welcome you to provide official results of any nationally 

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
or internationally recognized standardized tests you have completed. Test scores are an 

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
important part of your application. They provide us with a better sense 

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
of your English language proficiency, and of your ability to succeed at 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
NYU Abu Dhabi. But they are not the only factor on which 

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
your admission decision will be based. Please see our testing policy for 

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
complete details.

NYUAD is an open campus which members of the public are welcome 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
to visit. As such, when students are in public areas of the 

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
university, they are expected to dress modestly, in accordance with local custom. 

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Dressing modestly is defined as keeping your shoulders and knees covered. Dressing 

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
modestly does not include covering your hair.

I dont think suicide is bad or immoral at all. It is 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
a gross violation of personal autonomy to keep someone alive against their 

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
will. One has the right to give up their rights voluntarily, therefore 

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
one has the right to give up their life voluntarily. Besides, we 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
are not here to debate suicide, we are here to determine if 

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
I did it for love or not.

The Student Government is the voice of students within the NYUAD community. 

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
It serves and is ultimately accountable to the student body, upholding students' 

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
rights, promoting their welfare, and pledging to remain transparent and accessible to 

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
all students.

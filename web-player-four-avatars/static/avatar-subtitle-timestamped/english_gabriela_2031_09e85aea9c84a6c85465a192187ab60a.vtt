00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I fled the camp, and stumbled across a derelict building. I had 

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
an incident with a man there, and Aeneas defended me. The man 

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
died. Accidental murder is not exactly a good first date, but it 

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
does create a bond!

"When composing music, I sit down at the piano and I sing 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
random things that come to my mind, and so I start off 

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
with the melody and then I add lyrics. Or I open a 

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
software that will allow me to see what I’m working with, I 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
mean to hear what I’m working with and again, I try random 

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
things."

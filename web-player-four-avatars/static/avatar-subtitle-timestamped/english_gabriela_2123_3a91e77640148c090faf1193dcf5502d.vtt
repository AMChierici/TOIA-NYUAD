00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
You know. Go look for your miserable piece of land, and I 

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
ask the gods place place more storms and obstacles in your way 

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
that will shatter you. And I pray you be tortured crying out 

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
my name, and when your cry comes and finds me in the 

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
deepest of hades, then I'll know you are dead.

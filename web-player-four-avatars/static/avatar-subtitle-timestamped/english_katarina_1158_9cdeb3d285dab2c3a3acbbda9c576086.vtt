NYU Abu Dhabi residential colleges are divided into three buildings, where the 

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
floors are separated by gender. There are also designated areas within the 

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
residential colleges dedicated to non-visitation community, where individuals of the opposite sex 

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
are not permitted entry. Each floor has an assigned Resident Assistant (RA) 

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
to promote education, health, and safety and community development. Students are assigned 

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
either single or double (shared) bedroooms within each dorm.

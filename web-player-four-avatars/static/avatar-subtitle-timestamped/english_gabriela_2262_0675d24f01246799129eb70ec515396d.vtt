00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I am here to appeal the god's decision to send me to 

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
the field of tears to spend my afterlife, on the basis of 

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
erroneous judgement. The field of tears is the section of the underworld 

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
reserved for souls that wasted their lives for unrequited love. I, Elissa 

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
of Carthage, did commit suicide, but it was not primarily motivated by 

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
my lover's abandonment. In any case, Aeneas did love me. He did 

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
not abandon me for lack of love, but rather for lack of 

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
emotional intelligence and general maturity.

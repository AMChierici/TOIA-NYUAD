"English is the language of instruction at NYU Abu Dhabi. NYUAD does 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
not currently require an English language proficiency test (TOEFL or IELTS, etc.), 

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
however, we strongly encourage students to take an English language proficiency test 

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
and submit their scores. Excellent English language skills are critical to success 

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
at NYU Abu Dhabi. Please see NYUAD's official testing policy for more 

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
information."

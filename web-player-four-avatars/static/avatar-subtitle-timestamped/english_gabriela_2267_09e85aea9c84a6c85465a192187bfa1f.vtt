I don't think suicide is bad or immoral at all. There is 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
nothing intrinsically immoral in ending one's life. Life only has value if 

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
you believe it is intrinsically good, and I do not share that 

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
opinion. By cutting it short I simply ended my own suffering. I 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
believe this is my right. Besides, we are not here to debate 

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
suicide, we are here to determine if I did it for love 

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
or not.

English is the language of instruction at NYU Abu Dhabi. NYUAD does 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
not currently require an English language proficiency test (TOEFL or IELTS, etc.), 

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
however, we strongly encourage students to take an English language proficiency test 

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
and submit their scores. Excellent English language skills are critical to success 

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
at NYU Abu Dhabi. Please see NYUAD's official testing policy for more 

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
information.

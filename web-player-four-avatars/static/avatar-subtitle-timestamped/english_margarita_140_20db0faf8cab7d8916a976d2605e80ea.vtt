"When I was about four, I saw somebody play a piano so 

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I really wanted my parents to buy me one as well. My 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
parents refused at first, because they though it's just a whim so 

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
they told me that pianos are expensive so they wouldn’t get me 

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
one, and having no concept of money whatsoever I started collecting coins. 

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And one day I came to my mom with a fistfull of 

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
coins and I told her that I had gathered enough money to 

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
buy a piano! So that’s the day my parents realized that they 

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
really needed to get me a piano."

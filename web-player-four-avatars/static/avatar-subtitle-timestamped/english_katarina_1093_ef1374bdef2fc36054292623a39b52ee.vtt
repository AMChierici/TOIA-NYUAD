Yes. Citizens of all nations are welcome to apply, and admission is 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
'need blind.' Students are chosen based on their academic potential and qualifications, 

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
according to the same standards - including non-discrimination standards - that govern 

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
admission to NYU's campus in New York. Economic background and nationality do 

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
not influence our admission decision.

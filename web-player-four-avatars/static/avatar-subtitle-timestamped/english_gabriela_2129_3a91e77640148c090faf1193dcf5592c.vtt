00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Put up your barriers, set up your fencing, build your walls. Criss 

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
cross the ocean, comb all the deserts of the planet as much 

00:20.000 --> 00:31.000
as you like. We'll still keep pouring in. We'll unfurl in waves 

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
and you'll never be able to stop the flood. Because you can't 

00:41.000 --> 00:52.000
stop the ocean with your arms.

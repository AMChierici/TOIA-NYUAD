"Yes. Citizens of all nations are welcome to apply, and admission is 

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
'need blind.' Students are chosen based on their academic potential and qualifications, 

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
according to the same standards - including non-discrimination standards - that govern 

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
admission to NYU's campus in New York. Economic background and nationality do 

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
not influence our admission decision."

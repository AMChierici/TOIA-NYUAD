NYU Abu Dhabi encourages students to present their best case for consideration 

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
for admission. We welcome you to provide official results of any nationally 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
or internationally recognized standardized tests you have completed. Test scores are an 

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
important part of your application. They provide us with a better sense 

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
of your English language proficiency, and of your ability to succeed at 

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
NYU Abu Dhabi. But they are not the only factor on which 

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
your admission decision will be based. Please see our testing policy for 

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
complete details.

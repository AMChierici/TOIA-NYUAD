00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
By working every day. If you sit to write music once a 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
day for at least 30 mins, you'll get into the habit of 

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
having to do something even if you think you're not inspired. It's 

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
actually harder to sit down to work every day than it is 

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
to write something.

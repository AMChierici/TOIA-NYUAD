NYU Abu Dhabi residential colleges are divided into three buildings, where the 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
floors are separated by gender. There are also designated areas within the 

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
residential colleges dedicated to non-visitation community, where individuals of the opposite sex 

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
are not permitted entry. Each floor has an assigned Resident Assistant (RA) 

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
to promote education, health, and safety and community development. Students are assigned 

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
either single or double (shared) bedroooms within each dorm.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Students will submit their applications before November 1st and receive their admissions 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
decisions soon after on the 15th of December. Early Decision is binding, 

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
which means that any student who applies and is admitted to a 

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
school through Early Decision is expected to enroll. Whereas regular decision students 

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
must submit their applications before January 1st and the applications are non-binding. 

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
This means that upon acceptance the student still has the choice of 

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
choosing a different school.

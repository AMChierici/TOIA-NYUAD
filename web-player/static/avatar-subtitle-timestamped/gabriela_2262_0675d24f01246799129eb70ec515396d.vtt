00:01.000 --> 00:08.000
I am here to appeal the god's decision to send me to the field of tears to spend my afterlife, on the basis of erroneous judgement

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
The field of tears is the section of the underworld reserved for souls that wasted their lives for unrequited love

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
I, Elissa of Carthage, did commit suicide, but it was not primarily motivated by my lover's abandonment

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
In any case, Aeneas did love me

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
He did not abandon me for lack of love, but rather for lack of emotional intelligence and general maturity

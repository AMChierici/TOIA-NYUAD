00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
When I was about four, I saw someone playing the piano and 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
I really wanted my parents to buy me one. My parents refused 

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
at first, thinking that it's a whim and telling me that pianos 

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
are expensive, so having no concept of what money means I started 

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
collecting coins. So one day I showed my mom that I had 

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
a fistfull of coins and so she could buy me a piano! 

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
That was the day my parents decided that they really needed to 

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
buy me a piano.

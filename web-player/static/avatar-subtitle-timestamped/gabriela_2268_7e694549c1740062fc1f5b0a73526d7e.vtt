00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I dont think suicide is bad or immoral at all

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
It is a gross violation of personal autonomy to keep someone alive against their will

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
One has the right to give up their rights voluntarily, therefore one has the right to give up their life voluntarily

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Besides, we are not here to debate suicide, we are here to determine if I did it for love or not

NYU Abu Dhabi does not use numerical cut-offs when we evaluate applications. 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
However, admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is very competitive. As a general 

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
rule, applicants with the strongest academic programs, the highest grades, and the 

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
highest test scores are most likely to be offered admission. For more 

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
information, please see NYU Abu Dhabi's official testing policy.

NYU Abu Dhabi encourages students to present their best case for consideration for admission

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
We welcome you to provide official results of any nationally or internationally recognized standardized tests you have completed

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Test scores are an important part of your application

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
They provide us with a better sense of your English language proficiency, and of your ability to succeed at NYU Abu Dhabi

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
But they are not the only factor on which your admission decision will be based

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Please see our testing policy for complete details

"I worked as a summer camp coordinator at a camp in Japan 

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
in summer 2017 for a month and a half and it was 

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
so great but it was very tiring and I damaged my vocal 

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
chords so I donâ€™t think I can do that again as a 

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
music major."

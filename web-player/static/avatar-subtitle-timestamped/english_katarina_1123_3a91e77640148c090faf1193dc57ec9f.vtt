00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Students will submit their applications before November 1st and receive their admissions 

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
decisions soon after on the 15th of December. Early Decision is binding, 

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
which means that any student who applies and is admitted to a 

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
school through Early Decision is expected to enroll. Whereas regular decision students 

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
must submit their applications before January 1st and the applications are non-binding. 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
This means that upon acceptance the student still has the choice of 

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
choosing a different school.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
When composing music, I sit down at the piano and sing random 

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
things that come to my mind and start off with the melody, 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
after which I add lyrics. Or I open a software that will 

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
allow me to hear what I work on and again, try random 

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
things.

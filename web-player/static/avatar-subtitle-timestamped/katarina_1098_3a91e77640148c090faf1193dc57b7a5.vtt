00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Deadlines are extremely important

00:01.000 --> 00:10.000
We cannot guarantee that we will read applications submitted after the deadline date, even if only one piece of the application is missing

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
We highly recommend that you submit your application and all supporting documents as early as possible

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
If you foresee a delay in submitting any of your supporting documents, please contact the NYU Abu Dhabi Admissions office to discuss your particular situation

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Knowing the deadlines, you should plan the dates for your standardized tests accordingly, and give your recommenders plenty of time to complete their letters of recommendation

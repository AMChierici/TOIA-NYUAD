The Emirate of Abu Dhabi holds 9 percent of the world's proven 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
oil reserves and almost 5 percent of the world's proven supplies of 

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
natural gas. However, the government of Abu Dhabi is overseeing an ambitious 

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
strategy to diversify the local economy over the next two to three 

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
decades to ensure that the emirate continues to grow in a balanced 

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
and sustainable way.

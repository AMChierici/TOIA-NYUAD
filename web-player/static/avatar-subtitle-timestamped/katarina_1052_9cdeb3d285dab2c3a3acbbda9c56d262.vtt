Abu Dhabi is considered conservative but tolerant when it comes to dress code

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
Given the diverse nature of the population, one can see many different types of dress in Abu Dhabi (jeans, saris, business suits, dishdashas, and abayas)

For most of the year, lightweight summer clothing is suitable

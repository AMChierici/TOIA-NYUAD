"You are free to reapply if you are not admitted. However, we 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
make our admissions decisions based on a thorough analysis of each student's 

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
application and credentials, and we urge you to reapply only if there 

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
has been a meaningful change in your qualifications for NYU Abu Dhabi."

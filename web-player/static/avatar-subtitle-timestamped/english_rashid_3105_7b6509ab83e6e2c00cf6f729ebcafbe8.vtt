NYU is fully committed to the well-being of our students, and we 

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
will do everything we can to make sure a student's experience is 

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
both academically and socially fulfilling. However, should a student decide that the 

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
campus at which they matriculate is not the right fit for him 

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
or her, a request for a change of campus will be given 

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
consideration. If a request for change of campus is approved, the Financial 

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Aid office will evaluate a student's financial circumstances in the context of 

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
financial aid packages offered at the new campus. Financial aid packages vary 

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
greatly among our three campuses, so students should be aware of this 

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
reality should transferring become a consideration.

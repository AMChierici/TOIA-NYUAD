Yes, you are eligible to apply for admission to NYU Abu Dhabi 

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
even if you have started working toward an undergraduate degree at another 

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
school. However, regardless of the amount or level of coursework already completed, 

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
all students will enter NYU Abu Dhabi as first year students for 

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
a four-year course of study. At this time, however, we discourage students 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
who have completed two years or more of an undergraduate degree from 

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
applying.

"You can do that by implementing your projects into the world and 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
showing it to other people as opposed to only doing it for 

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
yourself. For example if you make music for film or you perform 

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
on-stage, or things like that, then you are going to get constructive 

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
criticism, hopefully constructive, and you’re going to be able to improve on 

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
your work, or you’re going to get nice positive feedback and compliments 

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
so that’s going to motivate you to keep working. And your work 

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
is never going to be perfect, and especially never to you, you’re 

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
always going to want to keep improving, but at some point you 

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
have to stop and start working on something else."

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
You do so by implementing your music into projects as opposed to 

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
doing it only for yourself. Show your music to the world - 

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
whether it's performing it on stage, making music for a short film 

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
or showing it to your friends, and you're likely to get some 

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
positive feedback to keep you going and some constructive criticism to improve 

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
your work!

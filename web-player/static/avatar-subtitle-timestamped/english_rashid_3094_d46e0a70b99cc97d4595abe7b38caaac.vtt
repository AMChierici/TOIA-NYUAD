Letters of evaluation and recommendation are extremely important. They give the admissions 

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
committee a more complete picture of your performance both in and outside 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
the classroom, from the point of view of a professional who knows 

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
you well. We consider these letters within the overall context of your 

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
application, and we may contact the counselors or teachers who write them 

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
if we have questions about a your performance.

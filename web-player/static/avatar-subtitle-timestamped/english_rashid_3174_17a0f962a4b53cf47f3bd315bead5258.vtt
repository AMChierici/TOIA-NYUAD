There are a number of programs organized by student life that offer 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
experiences to connect students to the local culture. These range from over-night 

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
trips to the Northern Emirates to conversations with Emirati professionals, mixers with 

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
students from other local universities, Ramadan and UAE Etiquette programming and so 

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
much more. All NYUAD students are encouraged to be curious about local 

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
culture and Campus Life as well as fellow Emirati students are passionate 

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
about enabling students to get to know their host country as much 

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
as possible.

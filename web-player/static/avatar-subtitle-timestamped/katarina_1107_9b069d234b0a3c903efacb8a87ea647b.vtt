NYU Abu Dhabi's Office of Financial Support will tailor the University's generous financial assistance programs to your individual needs

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Financial support will ensure that the cost of attendance does not require you or your family to take on debt to support the cost of your education at NYU Abu Dhabi

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Your family's finances should not affect your decision to select NYU Abu Dhabi, even if you are considering low- or no-cost public education alternatives or are the recipient of generous financial assistance from another institution

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
In addition, financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi will apply not only to the cost of attendance, but also to many activities and opportunities available to NYU Abu Dhabi students

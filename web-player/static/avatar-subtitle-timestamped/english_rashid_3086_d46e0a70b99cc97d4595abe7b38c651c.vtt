NYU Abu Dhabi does not use numerical cut-offs when we evaluate applications. 

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
However, admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is very competitive. As a general 

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
rule, applicants with the strongest academic programs, the highest grades, and the 

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
highest test scores are most likely to be offered admission. For more 

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
information, please see NYU Abu Dhabi's official testing policy.

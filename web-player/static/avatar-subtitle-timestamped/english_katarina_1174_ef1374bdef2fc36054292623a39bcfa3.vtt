There are a number of programs organized by student life that offer 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
experiences to connect students to the local culture. These range from over-night 

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
trips to the Northern Emirates to conversations with Emirati professionals, mixers with 

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
students from other local universities, Ramadan and UAE Etiquette programming and so 

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
much more. All NYUAD students are encouraged to be curious about local 

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
culture and Campus Life as well as fellow Emirati students are passionate 

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
about enabling students to get to know their host country as much 

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
as possible.

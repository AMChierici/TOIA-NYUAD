00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Deadlines are extremely important. We cannot guarantee that we will read applications 

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
submitted after the deadline date, even if only one piece of the 

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
application is missing. We highly recommend that you submit your application and 

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
all supporting documents as early as possible. If you foresee a delay 

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
in submitting any of your supporting documents, please contact the NYU Abu 

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Dhabi Admissions office to discuss your particular situation. Knowing the deadlines, you 

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
should plan the dates for your standardized tests accordingly, and give your 

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
recommenders plenty of time to complete their letters of recommendation.

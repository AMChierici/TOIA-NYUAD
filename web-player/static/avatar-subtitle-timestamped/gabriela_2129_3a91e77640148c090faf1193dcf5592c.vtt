00:01.000 --> 00:10.000
\ufffdPut up your barriers, set up your fencing, build your walls

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Criss cross the ocean, comb all the deserts of the planet as much as you like

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
We'll still keep pouring in

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
We'll unfurl in waves and you'll never be able to stop the flood

00:41.000 --> 00:50.000
Because you can't stop the ocean with your arms

00:51.000 --> 00:60.000

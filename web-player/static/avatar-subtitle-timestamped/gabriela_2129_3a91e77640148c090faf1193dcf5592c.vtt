00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Put up your barriers, set up your fencing, build your walls

00:10.000 --> 00:25.000
Criss cross the ocean, comb all the deserts of the planet as much as you like

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
We'll still keep pouring in

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
We'll unfurl in waves and you'll never be able to stop the flood

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
Because you can't stop the ocean with your arms

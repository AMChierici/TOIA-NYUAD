00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
I don't think suicide is bad or immoral at all

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
There is nothing intrinsically immoral in ending one's life

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Life only has value if you believe it is intrinsically good, and I do not share that opinion

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
By cutting it short I simply ended my own suffering

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
I believe this is my right

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Besides, we are not here to debate suicide, we are here to determine if I did it for love or not

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Our aim is to attract the best possible students regardless of financial 

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
circumstances. If you are admitted, our priority is to work with you 

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
and your family to make it possible for you to attend. NYU 

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Abu Dhabi's Office of Financial Support will tailor the University's generous financial 

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
assistance programs to your individual needs. Financial support will ensure that the 

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
cost of attendance does not require you or your family to take 

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
on debt to support the cost of your education at NYU Abu 

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Dhabi. Your family's finances should not affect your decision to select NYU 

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Abu Dhabi, even if you are considering low- or no-cost public education 

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
alternatives or are the recipient of generous financial assistance from another institution. 

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
In addition, financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi will apply not only 

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to the cost of attendance, but also to many activities and opportunities 

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
available to NYU Abu Dhabi students.

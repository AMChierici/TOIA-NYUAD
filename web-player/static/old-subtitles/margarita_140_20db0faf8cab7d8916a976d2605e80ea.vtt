00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
When I was about four, I saw someone playing the piano and I really wanted my parents to buy me one

00:08.000 --> 00:20.000
My parents refused at first, thinking that it's a whim and telling me that pianos are expensive, so having no concept of what money means I started collecting coins

00:20.000 --> 00:36.000
So one day I showed my mom that I had a fistfull of coins and so she could buy me a piano! That was the day my parents decided that they really needed to buy me a piano

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I am here to appeal the god's decision to send me to the field of tears to spend my afterlife, on the basis of erroneous judgement

00:12.000 --> 00:22.000
The field of tears is the section of the underworld reserved for souls that wasted their lives for unrequited love

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
I, Elissa of Carthage, did commit suicide, but it was not primarily motivated by my lover's abandonment

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
In any case, Aeneas did love me

00:35.000 --> 00:44.000
He did not abandon me for lack of love, but rather for lack of emotional intelligence and general maturity

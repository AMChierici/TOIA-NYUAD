GOALS/DESIDERATA

* Allows for analysis and generation (BAMA only does analysis)

* Morphological representation includes:

  - Full functional feature-value (new content)

  - Form-based feature-value (new formulation)

  - Form-based morph-meaning (this is BAMA)

  - Full segmentation and tokenization information based on form-based
    morphology; several tokenization schemes (BAMA has one) with consistent
    choices (BAMA is not consistent)

  - Functional (MAGEAD) and form-based (as we use in paradigm comletion)
    pattern/root/vocalism (BAMA does not have)

  - English glosses (BAMA has, but can get new)


* Sufficient lexical coverage (how is that defined?) 

  - Coverage of ATB* (BAMA has this, roughly, plus a lot more that is not
    in ATB*)

* Backoff

  - Smarter morphological backoff for unseen words: not just assume it's a
    PN (beyond BAMA)

  - Fuzzy orthography for input words (Alif forms, hamza forms) -- Nizar
    remembers that there were some specific ideas (perhaps go beyond BAMA);
    add common MSA spelling errors: Z/D etc.

* Probability of words out of context (can be derived from ATB) (not at all
  in BAMA)

* Tripartite database in one file (like BAMA, except for single file)

* Make classes in database aware of inflecional classes which are
  explicitly defined by us (under MAGEAD) and available as a resource
  (details to be worked out) (beyond BAMA)



OTHER GOALS

* Can re-annotate the ATB with full morphological representation used in
  CALIMA (largely automatic with possible subsequent annotation/error
  checking)




HOW DO WE GET THERE

These are preliminary thoughts.

* Derived from ATB (different from BAMA)

  - Gather all forms with segmentation, lemma, features
  - Fix the bad represntations in BAMA/SAMA such as the inconsistent
    handling of Al and ( +ap and +aY and many more) between tokenization
    and segmentation.) 
  - Do paradigm completion
    + Make use of iconic inflectional classes from Magead
    + Start with Mohammed Tantawy's list of sample verbs for various classes
  - Do something special for closed classes

* Glosses: various posssible sources, including MT techniques

* Backoff: need to code

* We need to do evaluation and error correction (LDC?)

* Lexicon: use other Arabic lexical resources




LEGAL ISSUES

* We want joint ownership so that we can distribute it freely

* EGY and IRQ should be similar, design should anticipate dialectal
  resources as well




PEOPLE:

* Columbia: Nizar, Owen, Ramy, Sarah

* LDC: Chris, Ann B, M Maamouri, ...?

Principal Components of BIG CALIMA


1) Corpora

- Annotated

- Unannotated

Existing resources: many


2) CODA Guidelines

Existing resources: have CODA for EGY, TUN


3) Morphological Analyzer

Existing resources:

* BAMA/SAMA etc
* CALIMA-EGY
* CALIMA-IRQ
* MAGEAD


Things we have done:

- Paradigm Completion


Issues:

- Modeling clitics
- Modeling inflections and inflectional paradigms
- The lexicon  



Possible approach

- Clitics: top-down
- Inflectional classes: by analogy to other variants
- Lexicon: using Paradigm Completion


Possible short-term tasks

- Relate verbal ICs in MSA, EGY; create new ICs for LEV, YEM and relate
  them





4) Morphological Tagger

Existing resources:

MADAMIRA-MSA
MADAMIRA-EGY

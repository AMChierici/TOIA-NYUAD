Students are chosen based on their academic potential and qualifications, according to the same standards - including non-discrimination standards - that govern admission to NYU's campus in New York. Economic background and nationality do not influence our admission decision	100.5910931174089	{'admiss': 42.526315789473685, 'admission': 42.526315789473685, 'admissions': 15.538461538461538}

2018-04-26 04:17:02	katarina	what are you	Our aim is to attract the best possible students regardless of financial circumstances. If you are admitted, our priority is to work with you and your family to make it possible for you to attend. NYU Abu Dhabi's Office of Financial Support will tailor the University's generous financial assistance programs to your individual needs. Financial support will ensure that the cost of attendance does not require you or your family to take on debt to support the cost of your education at NYU Abu Dhabi. Your family's finances should not affect your decision to select NYU Abu Dhabi, even if you are considering low- or no-cost public education alternatives or are the recipient of generous financial assistance from another institution. In addition, financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi will apply not only to the cost of attendance, but also to many activities and opportunities available to NYU Abu Dhabi students	95.41152597402598	{'what': 15.974025974025974, 'are': 38.4375, 'you': 41.0}

and <eos> i speak romanian russian french spanish and english <eos> ok how did you learn spanish
is it true that for exampl i guess this would appli to romanian or mayb but is it true that you guy can understand italian but italian can t understand you <eos> not necessarili we we do find mani similar in the languag i do recal part of the sentenc but it s not like i can understand what they re say are still differ languag but i can kind of get a feel of what they re talk about <eos> ok interest
so if you travel a lot <eos> after becom a student at nyuad yes i ve travel quit a bit <eos> what are some of your favorit place
have you ever been to like third world countri <eos> hum can you give me exampl of third world <eos> i don t know have you ever been to non western countri

it s the same in my grandma s villag <eos> yeah we re so similar <eos> haha well it was veri nice meet you and talk to you
hope we can do this again ok <eos> ok thank so much <eos> bye
how did you end up here whi here like it s so far away from home <eos> so my brother knew anoth moldovan friend who is studi here and he was graduat alreadi and i was suppos to find a univers for myself so i talk to him and i found out that there was a full ride scholarship that actual women are respect here that abu dhabi is safe that the opportun of this univers are crazi with all the travel and the peopl come here are high qualiti and becaus it s an american univers and i speak english i ve decid it s a good fit for me i alway want to go abroad for my educ <eos> have you alway spoken english
what are the craziest myth that you ve heard befor come here about this countri <eos> so i think just that as a woman you have to be cover complet mayb wear hijab anoth myth is that this place is unsaf polit unstabl while the uae is one of the safest place in the world and that everyon is arab and i would imagin peopl speak arab everywher but english is everywher so i never had to think about that or worri <eos> that s nice also whi the red
it s veri bold <eos> whi did i dye my hair red so i guess i like attent i have been die it sinc i was and i just decid that my brown hair doesn t stand out much i don t have ani crazi promin featur so it s like i ll dye my hair red a lot of peopl in my famili are either blond or red head so it kind of felt unfair that i got brown you know so it s like i m gonna stand out <eos> yeah i went through a phase too i had pink hair what is your stanc on legal weed
so would you feel the same way about like meth heroin coke becaus technic those <eos> i think befor there s more research done to see the harm and potenti of the other drug i can t take a stanc but of cours depend on what the research result are i m alway will to chang my opinion although for me right now that sound wrong becaus from what i know the other drug that are stronger and not you know like plant base smoke base like they re veri damag yeah but it depend of cours it depend <eos> yeah i was just watch documentari it s just my thing watch documentari about like differ type of law in differ region so i like was current watch one about i think it s somewher in california if i m not mistaken there was a claus i think it s forti nine where they lessen the basic peopl are no longer afraid of be caught with meth so like the whole citi is like a capit of meth so what do you feel about that doe that chang what you previous said
i never ask about your major <eos> yeah i m a music major and econom minor <eos> mm hmm how is it here music in like this region do you find it s differ
i feel like both but most how it sound <eos> so of cours the music in this region has this for lack of better word orient sound you know the scale a lot of the half step in between music term and i ve most focus on western music and classic music and electron music so sinc i don t speak arab i don t realli listen to a lot of music from here and sinc i ve grown in you know around than other type of music it s harder for me to accustom my ear to this but yeah i like how it sound when i hear it <eos> how do you feel like your perspect or like your valu or like you as a person has chang sinc you first came here
so what did you think femin was befor you came here <eos> so befor i wasn t realli a feminist yet i didn t know what it was i had no idea that i m disadvantag in ani type of way and right now i ve notic that actual you know as a woman it s harder to achiev a few thing some thing of cours at univers level or at an entri level job you don t see it that much but when you look at who are the ceo of the biggest compani you know it s alway men becaus you know there were men befor they still recruit men and it s a cycl that it s realli hard to break but look at all the presid of the us still no woman presid it s crazi <eos> i think especi here it s veri preval like i was do research about like how they re implement gender inequ law to reinforc like you know equal i guess in the workplac but last year they had gender equal award and all of those award were won by men so there was controversi becaus you final have these award and won by men how about like your percept of like religion like are you religi or
did chang like after come here and be be expos to like so mani other type of religion <eos> no i think i use to be religi until i was and then someth happen like i start watch documentari and i kind of thought i wait a minut doesn t realli make sens to me some thing like fact and all that i becam rebelli and all that but now i definit have more knowledg and understand and i see how similar all religion are befor i had the concept that the religion are crazi differ now i understand that they re all so similar and even the holi day happen veri close to each other i mean i understand that islam has more of a lunar calendar and christian is more about the sun but it s still built around the same thing <eos> and i think at the end it all preach the same i just wanna know like what did you think of like when you first heard about ramadan
so that s like one of the thing i just don t agre with i think the whole concept of ramadan is like feel what the less privileg feel and so they re not guard they don t have boundari like they see other peopl eat other peopl enjoy and they just don t have expens to like fulfil what they want either so it realli doe defeat the purpos which is whi i don t understand <eos> yeah and of cours i believ that you should be respect and you know we should be taught that you know alway if someon s fast be nice don t eat in front of them but when it s when made a law i m just i feel it s weird <eos> yeah becaus i think it make peopl uncomfort as well like if someon is restrict themself from eat in front of me and like i feel bad becaus i like i m do this for my own purpos like i don t like when a whole communiti like especi on this campus like when the whole like nyuad communiti is now restrict from eat freeli in the marketplac have drink in class like you know peopl have condit they have to yeah so like if you re do it you do it for yourself yeah i guess i m just gonna what els can i ask
yes i think how is your romant life or like your percept of it chang from be off campus to on campus becaus i think on campus like all kind of relationship are realli like on steroid like the smallest like a veri small conflict here just blow up and off campus like it wouldn t be that much of a deal like have you experienc thing like <eos> on campus i feel like relationship are veri sped up and they becom serious way quicker becaus you re around all the time and you accident almost spend way more time with a person than you should and then peopl even move in with each other at the begin but to be honest i don t think it s a bad thing i feel like it s just speed up the learn process you learn way faster who is not right for you <eos> but then i feel like all those small phase in the begin like you don t realli get to experi those
so do you think the a campus be isol on a separ island is like a good idea <eos> i don t think it s necessarili a bad idea in this context it make sens becaus where els would they have built such a huge campus they need space i assum and then they re build a citi around it right now it will take time but they will build it <eos> didn t it use to be in the citi
how about the apart and the offic be built in front <eos> what do you mean <eos> like how do you feel about that like i know you re graduat but like had you been like a freshman or like a sophomor when these offic or these apart are built like right in front of campus like doe that chang thing
no i think it s like this campus is alreadi veri open on it own and like we alreadi have like an endless amount of stranger come onto campus like they re alway like incid accid thing that happen that could be prevent and i think it s like realli it s veri odd i think becaus like be here for two year and it s like isol and then and you can see in the near futur that there are gonna be like a ton of peopl but alway come in and off campus <eos> but i feel like it s the same thing with other univers you know there is some restrict of who can enter but otherwis if it s a guest it s fine i guess have it more close would be weird becaus right now as well nobodi can enter resid unless you re sign in they lock out those door on the side so nobodi can sneak the non main door to campus entranc are most block so i feel like they re take that into account and do more would be overkil <eos> what s been the most memor thing from be just here
where did you go <eos> i ve been to new york bueno air pari and shanghai <eos> where did you go for the semest
how was new york <eos> new york is love it s my favorit place <eos> out of all of them
yeah <eos> so i feel like new york is veri live and someth is happen all the time and there is such a big divers of peopl and it s just there s alway someth to do so i d realli love to live somewher like that so that i can also achiev my ambit with lot of energi <eos> becaus like now it s like your postgrad period i know we ve talk about a bit but like do you actual see yourself stay in this countri for a longer time
i was go to ask ani citi specif <eos> yes dubai becaus abu dhabi is more of a famili place and i don t plan to start that too soon and the other citi or emir are conserv so it would be hard for me to fit in so dubai seem like the place <eos> what s your name
nice to meet you margarita <eos> nice to meet you too <eos> what did you studi here
were they both your major <eos> so i major in music but i minor in econom i was gonna doubl major <eos> but you didn t
what was the reason <eos> i was a bit behind on credit from my econom major and i was suppos to take a summer class but i also had an internship opportun in new york and i had to choos so i chose the internship in new york over the major <eos> you think that was worth it
so i m assum that you think that expertis and knowledg is more import than what there is on your transcript as if like major or minor as long as you have the expertis that there s no real need for that major thing to be on your transcript <eos> exact i mean the major is veri import as well but when you have more than one thing it s alway better i think of cours we live in a world in which the univers degre is import for your career so that s whi i m here <eos> oh nice so what do you think you ll be do after graduat you graduat but like say in one year what do you think you ll be do what do you feel your career will look like
oh good so you re use you re draw more on your economist knowledg than your music <eos> exact becaus i realiz the music industri is not as fun as i use to thing everi summer from freshman year until junior year i did three summer and everi year i would do an internship in a better record studio and onc i got to the pinnacl of my achiev i realiz that the industri is quit mess up so mayb in the futur i ll be abl to chang it but right now i don t want to particip in it accord to the rule that are set now <eos> oh ok what do you think you ll be do in year
so you came here four year ago of fish do you think do you think you accomplish or got to where you want to be or the goal you set befor you came here <eos> yes actual i think so it s a crazi thing in the freshman year we were all made to write a letter to your senior self and i was shock to see how mani of the thing that i ve alreadi done were actual in the back of my mind and i mention them i was like woah l i actual did all these thing but i did even more than i expect of myself but you know it feel like sometim when you reach a certain point you almost feel like oh i could have done better so even though technic i did everth i want to do i still feel like there s room for improv <eos> okay okay if you repeat your four year of nyuad what would you chang
so that s one thing <eos> yes and definit i would have repeat the same mistak becaus i ve learn from my mistak <eos> what made you come to nyuad in the first place
okay ok what would you look like had you not come to nyuad <eos> oh i don t even want to think about it caus my whole ident revolv about have grown in these for year at nyuad and all these countri where i ve been through this crazi univers i feel like mayb i would have been somewher in romania becaus that s a go to for a lot of moldovan student mayb studi someth like languag be an interpret translat mayb studi law mayb be somewher in europ but definit i would not stay in moldova <eos> okay so you want to come out of your countri
well what was the reason for you not to stay in your countri or want to go out <eos> moldova is the poorest countri in europ by gdp per capita and there are limit opportun and becaus of that peopl are also kind of miser and becaus of that they re not that polit and they re not that optimist and you know it s an environ that i didn t want to be in the peopl are love but the socio econom situat is so bad it s not an environ you can blossom in and my parent sinc i was veri young they instil this idea you re go to leav you re go to go to a better place and then in the end you re go to take us with you so it was never even in my mind to stay ever but now i m have these idea that mayb in the futur i should come back and actual make a chang becaus now i m becom less selfish and think onli about my famili i know that i ll be abl to support my famili i m veri confid that i ll be success so i m like hmm mayb now i can be also meaning as oppos to onli success <eos> ok so do you envis yourself go back to your countri as part of your profession career
ok do you think there is such a thing as give back to your countri or do you feel like a respons to go back and give back to your countri person <eos> i person have that respons but i don t feel like everybodi should feel that way in the end it s like we re live on one planet and you can make home anywher you go and the onli thing that differenti us realli from the other peopl in other countri is where you re born and that s it so everi countri is tri to take care of their citizen but some are fail and i feel like it s almost a littl bit of propaganda the govern are tri instil so that peopl don t leav their countri if they don t like it that you know that you should stay and give back i mean if if a countri is do nice thing for you what is a countri it s like if the communiti is do nice thing for you and love you at least is tri to push you up then of cours you feel a sens of duti that you should give back but nobodi owe anyon anyth just becaus they were born in a certain spot that s what i believ <eos> ok ok so it s out of nice of your heart
what about your parent you said they alway want you to go outsid of your countri and then take them with you later how els do you think they have influenc you as part of grow up <eos> so late i ve been think that my mother specif is so empathet and that it s not normal for everyon to be so empathet i didn t know she s so special until i saw other mom and she s a doctor as well so i think she s indirect taught me empathi she never said oh you must be empathet she just show it to me and now i m like that too so i realli care my dad has taught me a generos everi time i would ask for someth like ten dollar he s gonna give me i swear to god he alway doe that and he get so much pleasur out of it and i definit want to be like that too becaus i m a littl bit think stingi with my money i guess becaus of my financi insecur like i want to be secur but i want to be generous and kind and my brother is veri veri ambiti and he s five year older and i m take after him <eos> how mani sibl do you have
five year older you say <eos> yes he s five year older he is a softwar engin he is also tri to build his compani although in moldova that s realli hard so he might have to readapt and mayb go back into the job market but yes right now he s left his job to tri to start a compani <eos> in moldova
ok if you could describ your countri in a few short sentenc what would you say <eos> so moldova has a great climat we have four season it s amaz becaus we speak two languag from the veri get go and we have realli hot girl <eos> what els can we ask you
what would you miss most about nyuad <eos> so as the graduat speaker said after this univers be in such a divers environ where peopl are so accept and nice and intellig after you go out in the world there s not such a concentr communiti ofhi type of peopl anymor so i m actual terrifi of that i don t know i ll realli miss be surround by spectacular brilliant peopl all the time and i ll miss my friend a lot and i think i ll miss studi as well i love studi but i m also tire of it i want to go into the world but i know i ll miss it <eos> ok ok so you ll miss studi
where did you take your studi away semest <eos> i studi abroad in new york and bueno air and i did j term in pari and shanghai <eos> oh nice what was the most interest or your most enjoy cours you took at nyuad

see you ve got brown yeah black hair is realli uncommon as well what do you think these are such random question <eos> that s great that s great <eos> what drew you to this keyboard set i love flower so i m just curious
ok you earlier mention that you re not interest in start a famili soon do you imagin yourself have a famili in the futur <eos> i could have a famili in the futur becaus i have veri strong matern instinct i love babi and i love give love and care to other peopl so i d be a great mom at the same time i care about sustain issu and the issu of overpopul so i need to be sure that first of all i am intellig enough to teach them how to be sustain and all that but also make the decis of whether i want to adopt or just all these thing you know like i don t know i see liter myself both have kid and not have kid in the futur <eos> me too most not yes ok what els can i ask about
that s a good list how did your parent meet <eos> wow that s cute my parent met at a wed so they were friend of a groom and one was a friend of the bride and they met there and they start talk and then thing went wild yeah <eos> i thought you meant they met at their wed as if it was an arrang marriag
yeah and so what do your parent want for you do you know <eos> oh so my mom keep tell me first get a career and then famili she s like from my veri childhood she kept say that she say she doesn t want me to depend on anyon late i ve been also kind of all these weird ideolog to my mom becaus i m like sooner or later she has to find out but my altern lifestyl of think mayb not have kid or mayb have kid not say that i m not go to have kid but i m say there s a possibl mom my self worth is not equal is not determin by whether i have kid and she s kind of get use to this idea but she s realli hope that it s a phase and it will go away <eos> oh yeah yep sound familiar so altern lifestyl in the sens of children onli or also sexual
ok so you re worri about it back home but not on campus i hope <eos> not on campus no not late especi becaus the most of the time i also have been in denial so i wasn t tell peopl caus i was think am i just tri to be cool like am i for real or am i just tri to embrac everyth weird that i can think about but i found out later that i think it s a thing exact i was <eos> yeah you re speak to the treasur of anchorag group i ve been treasur for a year yeah ok so you mention a cherri tree cherri tree cherri tomato
what other childhood memori do you cherish <eos> so i think the snow caus we had a lot of snow dure winter and we d go down a hill with a sleigh we have a lot of hill in moldova and also go carol right now it s not a thing anymor becaus peopl you know have peopl have internet and they see all these crazi thing in the media and they think that the world has becom more danger when actual the few case that are mess up are just veri public in the media and peopl think oh no this happen all the time i shouldn t let my kid go alon at night carol at random hous but i rememb that back in my childhood our communiti was like a veri tight knit like a villag everyon knew each other and we d go and it was so fun and so pure and innoc <eos> ok so carol christma
oh that s amaz and what are your hobbi today or some of your favorit <eos> so i like rock climb and i like bike basic all sport that don t involv go to the gym and i like read although i should be read more and i love sing that s just so natur i m not say i m great i just like it <eos> ok have you had a chanc to sing in ani event on campus i feel like i might have seen you but i m not sure
and what kind of read do you like to do <eos> so i realli like scienc fiction but at the same time late it almost feel like a wast of time which is not true but it make me feel like i should be read book that teach me about life so book from economist about what s happen in the world or psycholog book about understand peopl more as oppos to just improv my vocabulari and my imagin with scienc fiction <eos> do you have a particular favorit
what s that <eos> so i don t rememb it veri well the plot is basic about space and how this littl boy was basic in the academi in space and you know it s in the futur basic there are alreadi multipl planet discov with life and all that and basic stuff goe wrong and this littl guy goe and save them he s like veri smart but not accept by his peer kind of like that <eos> ok i think i would have love to read that at one point in the phase in which i read diverg seri hunger game what did you graduat in
oh ok i would have expect mayb the other way around base on what you want to do in the futur <eos> yes my music was my passion all of my life and it felt like almost i owe to myself to studi it but also econom so i was tri to doubl major but i was behind on credit and someth but i feel like that i ve taken so mani class that i am qualifi <eos> ok yeah alright cool and what kind of music do you like or do you perform anyth or do you play a particular instrument
hi nice to meet you <eos> nice to meet you too <eos> so tell me more about yourself what did you studi
nice do you like music and econom <eos> yes that s whi i m studi it <eos> whi do you like music and econom
and did econom turn out to be the best thing <eos> it turn out to be a good thing mayb i wish i had taken comput scienc class befor but it s ok i graduat by the way so i don t regret ani of my decis <eos> congratul
so were you born and rais in moldova <eos> yes <eos> you ve spent your entir life befor come to nyuad there so how was moldova like
whi did you choos nyuad <eos> my brother had a friend and he studi here and when he graduat it was my time to choos a univers and i talk to him and he told me that it s so wonder and it s an american educ so it s in english and it s a full scholarship and the weather s great and i learn that there are so mani opportun and it s safe so it was a no brainer sinc i want to go abroad <eos> and did you regret it onc you came to nyuad
how mani peopl are in your famili <eos> there s four peopl there s my mom my dad my older brother and me <eos> how do you like to be the younger child
how s it like to grow up as a woman in moldova <eos> well at first sight it s normal and peopl in moldova would be veri confus by this question but now that i went abroad and i know what femin is and all that i can see that there s not equal opportun although women now are expect to work as well becaus peopl are like oh equal right women should work there s not actual the same attitud about hous chore and who take care of the kid so it s crazi although over time the respons of men went down the amount of them like they don t have to hunt for food anymor right they don t have to they just go to the offic now and it s good but now women have doubl their respons caus they still have to make the food they still have to clean the hous you still have to rais the kid but also they now do what men do and go to the offic so it s crazi yeah so i feel like it s veri similar in mani mani place around the world but of cours it s more so in conserv countri <eos> what s your least favorit part about nyuad
where would you like to live other than the place where you ve alreadi live in <eos> wow that s an amaz question so i guess i would definit like to go to new zealand and check it out it s first of all so far away and peopl seem realli open mind and nice there and especi with the news with the attack the way they ve dealt with it is just beauti i d love to be part of the communiti that s so care and open mind and consider about minor as well that sound cool but i m not go to activ work toward it you know it s realli hard it s not like a dream of mine i m just say if i were to choos a place in which i haven t been i d go there <eos> do you have ani dream
you said you want to open your own compani what kind of compani would you want to open <eos> so it would be either a music compani someth to help out the music industri in moldova mayb a stream servic kind of like spotifi caus at home stream realli is not a thing piraci is a big issu or i would do anyth els that s innov for exampl you know how right now there is an issu about the visibl of menstrual cup and they re veri healthi and veri sustain and just wonder so mayb someth like that you know someth that would be groundbreak in the countri <eos> tell me more about you as a child
tell me about your brother as a child <eos> oh he was shi i think i think he was the shi one more studi orient he was also veri proper kid he like to follow rule and sinc he had me who was younger he felt veri protect so that was veri cute but also he was not veri affection when he was a kid i was like oh give me a kiss give me a kiss and him be five year older he d be like ew no go away but later on that chang with time now he s affection as well <eos> tell me more about your relationship with your mom
like all mom <eos> yeah <eos> tell me more about your relationship with your dad
what s his view on life and what s your view on life <eos> he s veri conserv he s also religi and i m none of that and yeah he was upset that i would go out like at p m now as an adult at a univers to have tea with a friend he d be like it s where do you think you re go i was like excus you i was studi in a foreign countri for four year by myself and i did whatev i want and now i have to come at and so kind of like that but i know it s becaus he love me <eos> do you have ani pet
would you like to have a babi in the futur <eos> that s surpris frequent question that come up perhap becaus i have veri strong matern instinct and i love take care of someon and i care a lot but at the same time there s the overpopul issu the sustain issu you know so i m kind of in the futur we ll wait and see even adopt is an option in my mind but of cours it s nice to have at least one kid that you creat in your life hmm i m kinda curious what s gonna happen what s it go to look like it s go to act like <eos> what s your favorit place in abu dhabi
other than this campus <eos> i like walk along the watersid next to marina mall i think that s a veri beauti place to walk around at night i like eat wise i love go to chines hotpot <eos> if there was one social issu you could chang in this world what would it be
i guess i ll start with where are you from where did you grow up <eos> speak up by the way so i am from moldova i was born and rais there and my onli deviat was go to the us for an exchang year in my high school <eos> where in the us did you go
that s crazi whi wisconsin <eos> becaus it was a random place that they gave me that was part of the program that you don t get to choos <eos> ok and did you enjoy wisconsin how was that experi compar to come here as part of this american institut
moldova is quit like an unknown countri in my opinion i realli never met anyon from moldova until i came here it s like do you get that a lot <eos> yes definit everi time i say i m from moldova you can see the confus the glanc on peopl s face like oh i heard about it i don t know if i can pinpoint it on the map that s what peopl say and then i tell them that it s between ukrain and romania <eos> so the littl i know about moldova now is that like half or some of the popul speak romanian and the other half speak russian so do you speak both languag
so i think i was anoth convers i had with dan about that there s a countri within moldova that he s from somewher near the river <eos> so it s kind of like a region that s tri to be autonom but it s not recogn it s call transnistria it s divid from moldova by a river dniestr or nistru and it s basic a veri russian speak concentr place and get a lot of resourc i think from russia still so they re enjoy that and they also i feel like they would feel ostrac in other part of moldova becaus it s still expect for you to speak romanian even if broken romanian but sinc russian and romanian are so differ it s quit difficult and out of your comfort zone to just tri to speak it <eos> ok so you ve just graduat that s excit
let me think of a question <eos> that s okay just just be louder whatev you say <eos> so i mean you had your entir four year so i guess i ll ask you first where you studi away and stuff
so did you do a home sti in bueno air or did you say in the dorm <eos> there were no dorm back in my day in sophomor year i had to stay with a famili so it was an old ladi who onli spoke spanish by the way no english so that was great as you notic i like to talk a lot and i had to learn spanish to talk to her <eos> so do you think you re like comfort speak spanish now after it s been a while be there
you guy are crazi with languag i mean i tri to pick up languag but it just doesn t happen for me i feel like yeah i guess the two moldovan i know they speak like what five languag each is that a thing you grew up do or <eos> i guess becaus we from the get go speak like two or three languag caus romanian and russian is a given but they make us learn english or french as well at school it s three from the get go so you kind of get use to what it is like to learn anoth languag <eos> so what languag do you speak
how good is your french <eos> well i went to francophon school so i studi all my educ in french but i have a strong accent and i m lose my vocabulari <eos> so how can you pick bueno air over go to pari to practic french
what was your favorit part of bueno air i went to visit it in spring break i so i realli enjoy the scene so i wanna know what you thought of it <eos> i realli love the nightlif peopl are realli fun and they re veri kind of open and veri lgbtq friend as well so open mind about that but i didn t like the schedul like they eat so late at night and they go to bar like a parti can just start at a m i think that s too late unnecessarili late <eos> i didn t realli becaus they were so late i didn t realli get to do much of that well yeah the bar were empti at o clock which is insan
i guess what what do you like to do when you go out like are you a bar person are you club person <eos> i love club so i definit love pre drink at home with my friend then go there drunk right away i love club becaus i love danc and usual club have like a littl bar place too so i don t see whi you would go just to a bar caus the music is so loud it s so hard to speak <eos> i guess like i love club too but like i guess i would go to the bar first to make friend i m a veri social person so like my perfect night out would be to go to the bar with a friend meet like two to three peopl and then go club with them becaus what i ve notic i don t enjoy club with my friend becaus like there s no point in go out if you re go to stand in your friend circl
what would you do for fun here <eos> i don t realli go club here i would go to dubai sometim and club with my other graduat friend that graduat last year so i have friend in dubai now but otherwis i can just go to a parti on campus or you know just go hang out with my friend without drink or with my boyfriend <eos> so do you think campus is too small of a place to tri and meet new peopl
but in term of like you re talk about like you know if you date someon and you break up with them they re there all the time so i do like marhaba stuff a lot and freshman orient obvious there s like that formal orient they get but it s more like the inform orient that realli help them if someon is tri to make an inform guid do you think stuff like this belong in that inform guid like stuff like just be awar that you know if you re get involv romant or physic that it doesn t go the way you want to it is awkward afterward <eos> well i think mayb not state like that mayb peopl should say that it is a tight knit communiti so inform spread fast i don t know if you should write that in there caus peopl find that out veri quick anyway even though it s an inform guid make it into a guid is pretti freak formal so peopl would freak out and be like is it so bad that it had to be mention in write i would be freak out if it was like that like it s bad but it s not so bad you know i feel like peopl need to learn also to do their own mistak becaus it s like that everywher you go date can go wrong anywher you go gossip can go wrong anywher so it s a thing of be matur and learn that here it s slight more <eos> i respect that you were an ra dure how long have you been an ra
so your what was your floor design <eos> my floor design so i live in a c th floor it s lemur <eos> ok i saw that yeah how come whi lemur
so how is your experi be like a senior ra so i was think to myself like you know have senior girl live on your floor be an r a to them like were these your friend befor how did that relationship chang <eos> so i don t feel like my relationship chang to anyon i feel it would be more complic if i was younger than everyon els right sinc i am at least their age or older it was quit easi to navig that and i don t have to preach or be authorit i think my person is like i m tell you the rule if someth happen it s your fault and i m not go to be angri if you don t follow the rule it s not my job to be angri or bring my emot into it but it s your job to take in the consequ if they happen so with that attitud everyon s happi becaus you know i m chill and i don t get in peopl s busi and i felt a lot of respect from my resid and i respect them as well <eos> that s good did you alway want to be an ra and did you wait till senior year to do it
that s what i ask i want to be an ra but this is like the onli reason was i want to live with my friend in senior year and like you know be part of like a room and do all that so i went to ask and the answer was no becaus ras need that space in case anyon els need that space to have a privat convers do you think the role of ra here would be so complet differ from london and new york <eos> in new york it s veri veri competit so becaus there are so mani benefit in new york that could actual make a signific contribut to how much you pay for univers it s veri competit peopl are cut throat in those applic and i feel like they also take it way more serious dure the year it s not like we ras in nyuad don t take it serious we just know when we re suppos to take it serious like we know how to manag between be strict and be fun but in new york a lot of resid assist i feel like they just go crazi strict becaus they re afraid of lose their job becaus it s so import to them so they have a harder time navig between the two <eos> when you go to a pizza shop do you put pineappl on your pizza or not
but do you like pineappl on your pizza yes or no <eos> i am neutral to pineappl on my pizza <eos> it s a yes or no question i d like to know whether you like pineappl on your pizza
where was the last place you went out <eos> i think i went with my parent to emir palac to have tea with them my parent just came through for my graduat <eos> did you go to the louvr with your parent
what are you busi with these day <eos> i am quit busi i am work on the pptp program with nizar and alberto and that s whi i m here right now <eos> so do you think you ll go to the louvr now that you re not busi
what s your favorit memori from univers <eos> ooh my favorit memori from univers is i i think just two thing all the place that i ve been to and my parent be here for graduat was phenomen <eos> favorit place you ve travel to dure your four year here
yes i d like to know whi you like new york citi <eos> i like new york citi becaus it s just alway aliv there s someth happen at all time and there are peopl from all cultur background and it s veri real peopl don t fake what they feel they tell you what they feel <eos> do you have ani favorit spot around new york citi
which dorm did you live in new york citi <eos> i live in palladium although at first i want to go to gramerci they gave me palladium but then i didn t regret it becaus it s so close to everyth it s love <eos> do you have ani favorit street food spot around new york citi
what s your favorit thing to do when you re back home <eos> when i m back home i love hang out with my old friend if they re there and i love go to restaur and spend my money that i earn here there becaus it s worth way more in moldova right the convers rate then i feel rich and i eat good moldovan food <eos> do you feel you ve lost touch with your friend or famili after come to colleg
you feel like the bond that you made with your colleg friend is as strong as the one you ve had with your high school friend <eos> a littl bit i feel becaus here there is so much more divers and i think it s so hard to keep in touch when you re studi abroad and do all these crazi thing and they are so busi that you kind of have to make an effort to stay friend like close friend so i do feel like some of the peopl now are veri import to my life to a bigger extent <eos> go forward where do you see yourself this time around next year
whi pwc <eos> well becaus it is one of the biggest compani in the world of it kind and definit a key player in the middl east and my professor actual work there as well so i hope to work on her team <eos> which professor is this
doe she teach econom <eos> she teach strateg manag you should definit take her class if you can <eos> what s your favorit class you ve taken in your four year here if you had to name one singl class
we ll keep that on hold for now what s your opinion on like nyu stern and the peopl at nyu stern <eos> i feel like at nyu stern peopl get sometim this they re a bit judg by other for be snakey but i person met some realli great nyu stern peopl i feel like mayb the freshmen the younger peopl who get in are you know a littl bit arrog sometim but later on they becom great peopl the class they take are also quit good so it depend on the individu realli it depend <eos> so you would never hashtag i am stern kind of person
that s great to hear where els did you studi away just new york <eos> i studi abroad in new york and bueno air and i ve done a j term in pari and shanghai <eos> shanghai what are your favorit spot around shanghai
which pub was this <eos> i don t rememb the name of the bar but it was veri nice it was crazi i went there onc it s what stand out in my memori most <eos> but do you like shanghai
what mental is that exact <eos> so more conserv moldova and china what they have in common is be conserv becaus of the post communist era and less trust and smile less but also becaus i feel like they re are also hard work peopl and they re hustl all the time so they don t have time for that but i feel like with time it ll chang they re great peopl overal just like moldovan and they re great peopl but the situat polit and social is crazi <eos> so are you optimist that they re actual go to chang the mental over time

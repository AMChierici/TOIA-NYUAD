moldova s border are romania and ukrain and sandwich it s landlock
my favorit book is probabl bargain for advantag hum i m bad with name so good i rememb that but it is basic a book that talk about how to protect your interest when you talk to somebodi while still leav the other person happi so basic get what you want while actual satisfi the other person as well and build relationship
i m a music major and econom minor
i play the piano and the littl bit of ukulel and cello and i ve been play flute for a year i do sing but most in music i am i consid myself a compos and a sound engin as well so make it both both song lyric and music and make music for film
so my capston will be about me compos a piec of music that combin element of romanian folk music and russian step
exact
you can ask me about my favorit food or my friend or my famili
it is by eye you see the proport of food on the plate
sooo my famili consist of four peopl me my mom my dad and an older brother and yes i have a sibl he s five year older than me and he is a comput scientist and he is still in moldova
my brother isn t marri yet he has a girlfriend for about two year let s see what has happen
i would you say a bit less conserv than that conserv in a way that you have to marri basic the goal of life mayb you can marri later on depend on the famili again my famili s for exampl is encourag me to first work on my career and then marri but they definit want me to marri and i have a littl bit more of liber view of think you know that my goal in life is to be of use to the world and find happi for myself and not necessarili marri and marriag be just a great bonus if it work out but the famili doe not understand that they ll be veri sad if they don t get marri
puberti hu i had some friend who were also kind of go through the same stage i was go i was in a class and a lot of progress student they were quit smart we were test when we were young were select
of cours so those are two question do i think i would ever go back mayb of cours that s alway a possibl if i discov a religion that i feel veri close to caus right now i kind of describ myself as an optimist nihilist like noth matter but i m happi about that but you can do anyth caus in the end you know what i mean but i also hum i do pray sometim if i feel like it or sometim if i visit a church or a mosqu i feel so at peac i love all those ritual i feel i feel there is someth in it i just don t believ that is word for word what book say you know what i mean
when i m finish with what
i would rather not answer that question becaus i am a bit superstiti about thing if i say the exact citi of my plan but if that work out i ll let you know for sure i don t even tell my closest friend sometim
i feel like you could say doodl i dodl i make intric draw i am also veri into mathemat i didn t do much of it in colleg but i was alway good at it and i love it so i m kind of sad and i also love peopl i feel like mayb i have some interperson skill that have to util but i realli love social
what s my passion i don t know i like languag
  yes
i was studi abroad in bueno air on third semest and spanish is quit close to romanian root it s a latin languag so i pick it up with live with peopl who don t speak english at all and is veri into learn it with domingo and my class so i learn that semest
same as this as somebodi tri to tell me someth in chines then i would not have even a feel neither from inform niether from bodi languag neither but here everyth is like i have a hint at everyth
my favorit place ever is new york i hope to get back there at some point i just love how vibrant the citi is and there s alway someth to do and peopl are not over polit but they re not even as rude as peopl say like if you like eastern europ is way colder as a person than peopl in new york i feel it s the best mix of polit and leav you alon
the thing is moldova is the poorest countri in europ our gdp per capita is smaller than nepal so you could say that i am from a hardcor develop countri and i live most of my life there so my grandma doesn t even have a toilet just go behind the hous and i m so comfort with that if i was ever to becom rich and then lose everyth i wouldn t be even close to depress becaus i know what it s like to start from noth so i m lucki you could say biograph background inform current opinion about the self
we instal it like five year ago we have sold our way to like their spring we would have to gather water from the spring and now we instal like we made it well and put a system that would pump out the water
thank you it was nice to talk to you
goodby
i start learn english in fifth grade but i gain most of my english skill from music becaus i love sing so i love western music
whi what do you mean
my stanc on legal weed i think it should be legal becaus it doesn t have more harm than alcohol that s alreadi legal and i feel like when someth is illeg that s actual more danger becaus the product sold are not verifi
that i never heard about that befor so it doesn t realli chang what i think about it it depend again on what the research out there say if it s comprehens on the effect of such drug if such drug are still not research i think they they shouldn t be legal becaus it could be veri danger
do you mean the music sound in this region or the music industri in this region
so it s a great question i feel like i ve definit becom more toler and accept i alway use to think that i m also toler and i m so much better than other peopl i m so open mind but it s crazi look at my freshman year and find out that i actual was quit judgment and i had some preconcept about other nation and about femin and about thing like that so i feel like i m kinder and i m way more intellig
so i m agnost i think i was brought up christian orthodox like most peopl in my countri and i find religion beauti becaus i see that power for them to unit peopl but i sometim know it s also danger becaus of peopl misus it so mani of my closest friend are veri religi and the communiti they build through it and the valu they get from it is amaz but sometim when it s use as a polit weapon that kind of scare me and it disappoint me
ahh i was just surpris i didn t know much about it befor and i was like okay cool a new thing i was realli confus that in abu dhabi you can t drink or eat in public especi sinc my other muslim friend also say that in their countri they don t have that either
you can ask about my famili you can ask about my romant life you can ask about my passion
mayb not but then you will be abl to experi that in the futur and appreci it of cours i don t think it s an ideal environ for creat long term relationship but i feel like ani type of learn experi is a good learn experi
it did it did right so but then they build the campus becaus the univers need to expand and they need more facil but i am neutral about it some peopl like it some peopl don t it s i feel like it s almost a half prefer rate
whi would have apart be bad around is it like crowd it out
so mayb it s becaus it s been so recent but the graduat was spectacular and my famili was here and say good bye to friend and all that i ve also love of cours all the studi abroad experi they have chang me so much
bueno air and new york
yes do you want me to tell you whi
i do but not forev i don t see myself stay forev in ani place ever i just i am free bird i would love to bring my parent here or anywher i go but in the uae i d definit stay for like five year i love especi dubai
my name is margarita
i studi music and econom
i didn t doubl major do you want me to tell you whi
i think it was worth it becaus i took so mani class in econom that i have the knowledg and i can tell peopl just oh i studi music and econom i don t have to delv into what s a major and minor peopl outsid of this univers don t know what that is anyway so as long as i have the expertis i m not lie that i studi music and econom
i hope to mayb work in consult right now i m appli for job i m still interview so mayb work in transfer price tax would also be fun
in year i hope to have my own busi i definit want to contribut to the world in a way i am veri passion about climat chang overpopul issu philanthropi in general so i hope to be a businesswoman and have an impact on the world
i would have taken a comput scienc class earlier liter i would have taken it in my freshman year mayb i would have made it my minor on my major i took it in my junior year and that was quit late
so my brother knew anoth moldovan student that was go here and he was graduat and it was my time to appli so he was in moldova in my home countri and i was there too so i was abl to ask him all this question and he told me that this univers give you a full scholarship and that the peopl are so amaz here and that the educ is good qualiti you get to travel and that the uae is super safe he broke all the stereotyp so it seem like the place for me and it s an american institut it s in english and i realli want to studi abroad
yes i ve been in the u s for an exchang year befor for one year and i love that so after i finish high school i want to replic that
mayb in the futur not now for sure but mayb in ten year yes
that s nice of you to say i d love to believ that i m kind and altruist i don t know if i don t know if i m altruist you know there s actual this debat that even altruism can be selfish becaus mayb you re just do it so that you feel better or mayb you re do it for the imag of it or mayb i don t know i d like to believ that i m kind and that i m driven by this set of valu that isn t selfish i would love to believ that
i have one older brother
  yes
you can ask me about my passion you can ask me about my famili you can ask me about prefer in food in countri you can ask me about my friend you can ask me about my fear anyth
yeah that s crazi but can you imagin not have to worri about food then get to travel and just you know just enrich your knowledg mess around yeah
do you mean just at the nyuad campus or across
i love about negoti that it teach you how to get what you want without screw over the other person so get the best outcom for you while also build the relationship and make sure that you know to negoti ethic a littl bit of ethic in there but also you know how to make a conflict into an opportun and that you don t have to be you know assert and an angri negoti to get good result and that sometim the thing we ask for is not necessarili what we need like there s a an interest behind them and so basic how to navig that so basic you can negoti job salari you can negoti which movi you watch with a friend you can negoti with your mom who you re gonna marri anyth anyth
thank you
wisconsin
oh i do i sometim do but not to the point to be like oh i want to go back and live there no i miss the peopl from my home and i do miss a littl bit of the natur we have this realli cool cherri tree at myy hous that i spent my childhood climb
i m go to go home at the end of juli
so it s nizar
becaus the sheikh s plan work and i start love this place and abu dhabi is a bit more famili orient and i don t plan to start one too soon and dubai is a bit more wild and more accept toward peopl like me who dress up like me who behav like me
i don t know i guess i like attent i mean mani peopl in my famili are either blond or ginger or someth and then i got brown so i felt like it s unfair so i went for someth differ yeah my dad has black hair and my mom is super blond her hair was like almost white in her childhood
so i want a keyboard cover becaus if you spill someth that protect your keyboard but i just thought it look realli pretti and floweri i like flower and although it kind of cover the letter i don t look at the letter anymor so i think it s even color i mean my mom who doesn t type fast was realli annoy with my keyboard she was like i have to look for letter now but i was like i don t even look
you can ask about my famili or my passion or my hobbi or my fear
that s not a thing in eastern europ you were forc to marri as soon as possibl in the begin back in the day right now it s differ but my mom s generat was almost guilt into marri as soon as possibl at least in colleg if you went to colleg becaus it s like after colleg all the good one are gone or like you re get to old and what if you aren t abl to get kid it s a bit crazi
yeah that as well yeah i mean i am bisexu but i don t go too loud about it i am still afraid of be judg even though my letter from the lgbtq is i feel the most privileg and easiest to hide and to pretend that you re straight but still at home peopl are quit judgment
yeah you re right cherri tree
yes christma as well yeah i rememb my parent lie about santa and me be like yo i m not that dumb i ve been told my kindergarten friend said
sometim i sometim sing at open mike but not that often becaus i guess i m such a perfectionist that i don t get thing done sometim you know it s take a toll it s like oh but i m not still readi yet to sing the song so mayb next time caus i m busi but sometim sometim i sing
i read all the diverg book they re pretti cool ender s game was pretti cool
oh so i am a music major and econom minor
so i like all type of music i love electron music and classic music and pop music and i do like perform but i m more of a compos and sound engin and also i play piano and flute and a bit of cello and ukulel
so my name is margarita i am from moldova and i studi music and econom
so music was my passion for most of my life and econom is just anoth thing that i want to do someth smart as well not just artsi and sinc i love math i thought econom was the best thing i d ever done econom befor so i had no idea what it is
thank you
moldova is veri interest it s a post soviet countri it use to be part of romania it border romania and ukrain onli it s landlock no mountain just hill and river but peopl are veri nice but it s the poorest countri in europ so they re kind of depress and sometim they can be short temper becaus the socio econom situat is so harsh so i alway had the dream to get out and go somewher els for my studi and my career
no i think it was the best decis i could do in my entir life i didn t expect that i would think that that i d be so grate but like when i was come here i knew it s good but i wasn t sure it was one of the option i guess in my mind but definit the opportun that we get here and the qualiti of peopl is so high and it s just a wonder environ to studi and grow
well i love it becaus i kind of got more attent becaus i love attent but becaus i m a girl i wasn t allow to go out with as late and all that but i was still lucki that my brother got to go abroad first so that i was allow to go alon abroad as well you know especi to an arab countri which my brother wasn t allow to do and then i grew up five year later and then i talk to his friend who graduat by then and that s when i realiz that all the preconcept about the middl east aren t entir true especi about the uae
my least favorit part about nyuad is the fact that when we studi abroad it s harder to maintain relationship and you find that peopl keep studi abroad at differ time so you could not see your friend mayb for a whole year and a half becaus you keep studi in differ place at differ time so it s veri hard to maintain good relationship but at the same time becaus there are not that mani peopl at this univers and it s such a tight knit communiti that s kind of equal by that you know like there s a balanc caus then you come back and then you see them all the time
do i have ani dream sure i feel my biggest dream is to make enough money so that i can give my parent anyth they want so that they can travel more and bring them wherev i go and then afterward i do want to do someth that s impact on the world mayb do some philanthropi open my own compani becaus otherwis i don t see mean in life i m not say everyon should do that for some peopl the mean of life is to find happi for me happi will come from mean you know find a purpos in life bla bla i guess i was brainwash by this univers to actual do the thing that i said on my applic
attent seek child realli loud veri energet mean sometim but i didn t know that i thought that was the best i was the smartest one in my kindergarten but then i was given school of smart kid then i sudden was averag so my ego normal my confid drop to normal level and yeah i think i was cute and funni
i love my mom she is actual surpris a close friend to me she s way more open mind than most of the mom that i know at this age and grow up in such a conserv countri and she s veri empathet and she s veri veri kind so i kind of learn that from her as a second hand effect she never preach it to me so i realli admir her and love her and i just want to find a way to pay her back somehow but she also love control and it s sometim annoy when she s like put on some makeup and i m like no i m beauti this way
yeah my dad is also a cute person he keep offer to make me tea all the time and he alway give me more than i ask like if i ask for ten dollar he s gonna give me this is just so nice alway he just get posit energi from that but sometim we have differ view on life and we don t agre but we just we don t push it on each other that s the love thing we don t push each other s idea on each other
i have a dog at home and i have cat i m not that close caus i m not home all the time my parent are close to the pet but i d love to have a cat in the futur i m a cat person
my favorit place in abu dhabi i think this campus
there s so mani there s so mani the one that s most import to mei think it would be the environment chang for us becaus i feel like the clock is tick the other thing aren t more fair like i don t know sexism racism they re not ani less urgent but they re not finit wherea the planet is finit and i feel like we need to act now
i went to wisconsin
so becaus i went to a quiet littl town in there it was not as intern as here and their opinion weren t as open mind there was a certain way of life but it was realli fun becaus i did make some veri good friend
i do i do so most peopl actual see both but you re right half of it has primarili one languag and half the other even we have some region in moldova that speak primarili ukrainian or bulgarian becaus peopl migrat at some point
i m so excit to graduat
yeah so i studi away in new york and bueno air and i did a j term in pari and shanghai
well after it s been a while i m not as fluent but i definit can hold a convers or just go for it like of cours it s way easier to recogn word than produc sentenc but i could if i go there for a month i ll be back on track
so i speak romanian russian french english and spanish
becaus i feel like i ve had so much of french most of my life you know and it s just bueno air is also so far away and so foreign and i want to go to a place veri far and also i knew that spanish is even closer to romanian than french so i knew that i have a good chanc to learn it so i start learn it by myself a bit befor come there and then onc i arriv there i pick it up in a semest
yeah o clock is not the time for bar
so you go alon usual
no definit not of cours we don t have that mani peopl as the new york campus for exampl or ani other campus but the qualiti of peopl here is so high and i don t think is that hard to meet new peopl it depend on what you like as well and for some peopl it s suffoc to date someon here becaus you accident see that person all the time and you don t get your privat space but in term of meet new peopl i think this univers is realli good becaus peopl are nice
so i ve been an ra for this past year senior year and i m a summer ra right now too for two month
so we had like half a year to think about anyth and then i had so mani thing i was think mayb bojack horseman or someth cute like a museum instal but then the day befor the deadlin i was like lemur no reason like i have noth with lemur i have no past or no predilect toward lemur i just thought you know what someth random lemur and then i just found thirti five lemur on googl i hand pick them the most hilari and ugli one and that s how my floor theme came to life
freshman year you can t be ra sophomor and junior year i was studi away but in junior year i had this urg that i need to be in a ra in senior year i just need to be and i know the pay is good as well and i knew it s the type of job that i would be realli good at caus i love peopl i love love love love peopl and i want to feel like i m make an impact and i actual wasn t that excit about the singl room i d love to be in a singl room in an apart with my friend that s so much more fun
no i just ask for whatev pizza i want in that moment
yes you can ask me anyth you can ask me about my famili you can ask me about my passion you can ask me about my friend liter don t complic it
my parent did have time to go to the louvr but i didn t join becaus i had some work
i ve been to the louvr befor i ve actual been with the univers right when it open
new york citi is definit my favorit place do you want me to tell you whi
i do love washington squar park and i love central park a lot i love bike around central park
the one in front of palladium becaus there s the food cart right in front so you don t have to go far but palladium also has a great canteen again you don t have to go far to eat
ooff i feel some of them but i feel like my real friend are still there for me even though we don t talk about much and i would be there for them and everi time i come back we hang out even though we didn t speak for like a year
i actual don t know i am appli for job right now i am hope to be work at pwc in transfer price even though i m a music major and econom minor but we ll see what els come around mayb consult mayb someth in music
this is alicja reuben

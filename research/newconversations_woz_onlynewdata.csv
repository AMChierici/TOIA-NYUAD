2,All those four years?,"I wish I could see more places, but I'm not too crazy about visiting places for a brief period of time. I prefer that if I go somewhere that I spend at least half a year there or at least a month and so I am not quite passionate about short trips because they exhaust me, so I guess...

2,And what about the food. Do you like the food here or...?,Do you mean if I like Arabic food or the NYUAD food?,,,,,
2,"Hu.. no, the Arabic food.","Sometimes it is little more spicy than what I'm used to. And I have a very sensitive sense of taste and smell.

2,And what's the cuisine like in Moldova?,"So Moldova used to be part of Romania and the Russia - Soviet Union. So the foods are combined from all over the place. We have some Romanian food.

And the western food is everywhere.",,,,,
2,"Do you miss the food, the Moldovian cuisine?","I used to more then, but now I got so used to just changing my diet depending on where I am at that time.

2,And are you a coffee person or a tea person?,"I love that question! hum... Both! I love tea because you can drink it as much as you want and feel fancy.

So basically getting what you want while actually satisfying the other person as well and building relationships.",,,,,
3,"Is it not like ""the art of the deal""... that Trump book?",It could be but I feel like the Trump book could be more about tricks things. You know this book is more about it's more psychology based so that you actually understand why you're doing so that you don't have one set way of acting in a specific situation but so that you can tailor any moment to anything just based on understanding what the other people are feeling and what you want.,,,,,

3,"Conservative you mean... Conservatism like big size, kind of like marry early? What do you mean conservative?","I would say a bit less conservative than that. Conservative in a way that you have to marry. Basically the goal of life. Maybe you can marry later on, depends on the family again. My family for example is encouraging me to first work on my career and then marry, but they definitely want me to marry and I have a little bit more of a liberal view of thinking, you know, that my goal in life is to be of use to the world and find happiness for myself and not necessarily marry, and marriage would be just a great bonus if it works out. But the family does not understand that, they'll be very sad if I don't get married.",,,,,

3,OK. Did you went to a special school?,"Of course. So those are two questions - do I think I would ever go back? Maybe of course that's always a possibility. If I discover a religion that I feel very close to. Cause right now I kind of describe myself as an optimistic nihilist. Like ""nothing matters!"" But I'm happy about that! But you can do anything cause in the end.. You know what I mean. But I also, hum... I do pray sometimes if I feel like it or sometimes if I visit a church or a mosque I feel so at peace. I love all those rituals I feel I feel there is something in it. I just don't believe that it's word for word what books say you know what I mean?",Sure!,Yes.,,,

I have many different plans, either to continue my studies at grad school and get my masters degree or go into consulting or get a job in the music industry, hopefully composition and technology.","I'm planning to go to grad school in New York, with the only grad school I'm applying and I do not see my future in Moldova. I see myself maybe passing through from time to time to see my family and friends but I would rather bring my family my small family of four people with me abroad than have to come back home.",,,
3,With the university. What would you want to after you finish with the university?,"I am thinking to either go to grad school, do a master's degree or get a job in consulting or get a job in the music industry as a composer or sound engineer.","After I graduate.

3,Is there a specific place you want to be afterwards?,I would rather not answer that question because I am a bit superstitious about things. If I say the exact city of my plans. But if that works out I'll let you know for sure. I don't even tell my closest friends sometimes.,My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,"New York was definitely my most favorite place on earth and that's why I hope that in the future I'll be able to go back but I will have to sort out the visa issue and all that because I have... hum, I am a citizen of Moldova which is not the European Union so it will be tough to get a visa.",,,
3,What else can I ask you?,You can ask me about sports that I like. Or you can ask me about...,"You can ask me about my passions, my family, my career plans... Anything.",You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,,,
3,Do you have another passion that's other than music?,"I feel like you could say doodling. I dodle, I make intricate drawings. I am also very into mathematics. I didn't do much of it in college, but I was always good at it and I loved it so I'm kind of sad. And I also love people. I feel like maybe I have some interpersonal skills that have to be utilized. But I really love socializing.",I love drawing sometimes but abstract basically that link. I loved volleyball and biking a lot and I am very interested in negotiation as a science and the aspects of communication.,,,,
3,"OK, hum...",What about you?,No Worries. Take your time.,,,,
3,Are you allowed to ask me questions?,What's my passion? I don't know.. I like Language.,,,,,
3,I like languages as well. How many languages do you speak?,I speak five languages.,I speak five languages. So my first language is Romanian and Russian. And then I learned French and English at school and recently I learned Spanish.,,,,
3,French I'm guessing.,Yes.,Mmh my school... I went to a francophone school which means that everything was taught in French. That was an experiment that started the year I had to go to school. My parents decided to try it out. So we had to be tested to know if we really will be able to handle it. And so many of the students as well were going through the stage or they were questioning religion as well. And that kind of affected me too. But I was always a rebel.,"I speak Romanian, Russian, French, Spanish and English.",,,
3,And...?,"I speak Romanian, Russian, French, Spanish and English.",,,,,
3,OK. How did you learn Spanish?,I was studying abroad in Buenos Aires on my third semester and Spanish is quite close to the Romanian roots. It's a Latin language. So I picked it up while living with people who don't speak English at all. And I improved with Duolingo and my classes. So I learned it that semester.,,,,,
3,Is it true that for example - I guess this would apply to Romanians or maybe. But is it true that you guys can understand Italian but Italians can't understand you?,"Not necessarily. We... We do find many similarities in the language. I do recognize parts of the sentence, but it's not like I can understand what they're saying. They're still different languages, but I can kind of get a feeling of what they're talking about.",,,,,
3,"OK, interesting.",Same as this. As somebody tried to tell me something in Chinese then I would not have even a feeling neither from information niether from body language neither... But here everything is like I have a hint at everything.,Oh yeah.,,,,
3,So have you traveled a lot?,"After becoming a student at NYUAD, yes. I've traveled quite a bit.",,,,,
3,What are some of your favorite places?,My favorite place ever is New York. I hope to get back there at some point. I just love how vibrant the city is and there's always something to do and people are not overly polite. But they're not even as rude as people say. Like if you like Eastern Europe is way colder as a person than people in New York I feel it's the best mix of politeness and leaving you alone.,"New York was definitely my most favorite place on earth and that's why I hope that in the future I'll be able to go back but I will have to sort out the visa issue and all that because I have... hum, I am a citizen of Moldova which is not the European Union so it will be tough to get a visa.","I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music, both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture. It's very it's quite futuristic even though some people might say it's dirty in some places but I love that it's always awake and people aren't overly polite nor actually overly rude because Eastern Europeans are quite cold in general. So I felt like it was a great balance. And there are many many people and so many diverse people and languages and so many cultures.",,,
3,Have you ever been to like third world countries?,Hum... Can You give me examples of third world?,Sure!,Yes.,,,
3,I don't know… Have you ever been to non-Western countries?,The thing is Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. So you could say that I am from a hardcore developing country and I lived most of my life there. So my grandma doesn't even have a toilet. You just go behind the house and I'm so comfortable with that. If I was ever to become rich and then lose everything I wouldn't be even close to depressed because I know what it's like to start from nothing. So I'm lucky you could say.,"I'm from Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe.",,,,
3,"Yeah, that's facinating. So no toilet in your granny house?","Haha! Exactly, you heard me well.",Yes.,,,,
3,Yaah... did you... was there water?,"We installed it like five years ago. Before we would have to gather water from the spring. And now we installed like... We made, we dug a well and put a system that would pump out the water.",,,,,
3,It's the same in my grandma's village.,Yeah? We're so similar!,,,,,
3,"Haha, well, it was very nice meeting you, and talk to you",Thank you! It was nice to talk to you.,Nice to meet you too.,It was so nice to meet you too! Thank you for talking to me!,,,
3,Hopefully we can do this again. OK,OK. Thank so much!,Yes.,,,,
3,Bye!,Goodbye!,,,,,
4,How did you end up here? Why here? Like it's so far away from home.,"So my brother knew another Moldovan friend who is studying here and he was graduating already and I was supposed to find a university for myself. So I talked to him and I found out that there was a full ride scholarship, that actually women are respected here, that Abu Dhabi is safe, that the opportunities of this university are crazy, with all the traveling and the people coming here are high quality, and because it's an American University and I speak English I've decided it's a good fit for me. I always wanted to go abroad for my education.","My brother used to know somebody who went here because they went through the same exchange program and actually my brother wanted to go here first, but my parents were afraid of the situation in the Middle East. As religious Eastern European middle aged parents they did not know that much about the Middle East and they were worried about their kids, but once that guy graduated and it was my time to fly I got to ask him all the questions and I knew that it's safe and it's actually a great place to be so...",,,,
4,Have you always spoken English?,"I started learning English in fifth grade, but I gained most of my English skills from music because I love singing. So I love Western music.",I speak five languages. So my first language is Romanian and Russian. And then I learned French and English at school and recently I learned Spanish.,,,,
4,What are the craziest myths that you've heard before coming here about this country?,"So I think just that as a woman you have to be covered completely, maybe wear hijab. Another myth is that this place is unsafe, politically unstable, while the UAE is one of the safest places in the world. And that everyone is Arab and I would imagine people speak Arabic everywhere but English is everywhere, so I never had to think about that or worry.",,,,,
4,That's nice. Also why the red?,Why? What do you mean?,"Thank you. Yes I guess. I don't have another crazy standing out feature, I thought ""might as well dye my hair red"". But actually lately I've been thinking whether I should die it back to brown because although I like attention I start to notice that I like attention when I want it. And now it's like very easy to recognize me in the crowd and I want to go more incognito in the future.",,,,
4,It's very bold.,"Why did I dye my hair red. So I guess I like attention. I have been dying it since I was 14 and I just decided that my brown hair doesn't stand out much. I don't have any crazy prominent features so I was like ""I'll dye my hair red"". A lot of people in my family are either blond or red headed. So it kind of felt unfair that I got brown, you know, so I was like I'm gonna stand out.","Thank you. Yes I guess. I don't have another crazy standing out feature, I thought ""might as well dye my hair red"". But actually lately I've been thinking whether I should die it back to brown because although I like attention I start to notice that I like attention when I want it. And now it's like very easy to recognize me in the crowd and I want to go more incognito in the future.",,,,
4,"Yeah I went through a phase too, I had pink hair. What is your stance on legalizing weed?",My stance on legalizing weed. I think it should be legal because it doesn't have more harm than alcohol that's already legal. And I feel like when something is illegal that's actually more dangerous because the products sold are not verified.,,,,,
4,"So would you feel the same way about like meth, heroin, coke because technically those...?","I think before there's more research done to see the harms and potentials of the other drugs I can't take a stance, but of course depending on what the research results are I'm always willing to change my opinions. Although for me right now that sounds wrong because from what I know the other drugs that are stronger and not you know like plant based, smoking based, like they're very damaging. Yeah but it depends of course it depends.",,,,,
4,Yeah I was just watching documentaries. It's just my thing watching documentaries about like different types of laws in different regions. So I like was currently watching one about... I think it's somewhere in California. If I'm not mistaken there was a clause. I think it's forty nine where they lessen the... Basically people are no longer afraid of being caught with meth. So like the whole city is like a capital of meth. So what do you feel about that? Does that change what you previously said?,That... I never heard about that before. So it doesn't really change what I think about it. It depends again on what the research out there says if it's comprehensive on the effects of such drugs. If such drugs are still not researched I think they they shouldn't be legal because it could be very dangerous.,,,,,
4,I never asked about your major?,Yeah I'm a music major and economics minor.,I'm a music major and economics minor.,I study music and economics. I'm a music major economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.,So I majored in music but I minored in economics. I was gonna double major.,,
4,Mm hmm. How is it here music in like this region? Do you find it's different?,Do you mean the music sound in this region or the music industry in this region?,"I think Arabic music is very intricate and it sounds exotic to me... Because I do not know that much about it, but I think it is very rich and beautiful.",,,,
4,"I feel like both, but mostly how it sounds.","So of course the music in this region has this, for lack of better words, Oriental sound. You know the scales, a lot of the half steps in between (music term) and I've mostly focused on Western music and classic music and electronic music. So since I don't speak Arabic I don't really listen to a lot of music from here. And since I've grown in, you know, around other types of music it's harder for me to accustom my ear to this. But yeah I like how it sounds when I hear it.","I think Arabic music is very intricate and it sounds exotic to me... Because I do not know that much about it, but I think it is very rich and beautiful.",,,,
4,How do you feel like your perspective or like your values or like you as a person has changed since you first came here?,"So it's a great question. I feel like I've definitely become more tolerant and accepting. I always used to think that I'm also tolerant and I'm so much better than other people, I'm so open minded. But it's crazy looking at my freshman year and finding out that I actually was quite judgmental and I had some preconceptions about other nationalities and about feminism and about things like that. So I feel like I'm kinder and I'm way more intelligent.","I guess we all come with some preconceptions. Mine I feel are more subconscious because I consciously try to be accepting and tolerant and be like ""Not better, not worse, just different"" you know. But on a subconscious level I think there might be still some, you know, preconceptions of when I see someone, by their looks I might assume their status or something and I try not to think like that. A thing that I improved on during the years, when it comes to my mentality, is about feminism and not judging other women. Because I was like... I was quite judgmental and I didn't know. I didn't know I'm judgmental. I thought, for example, like if somebody didn't shave their legs I would notice and be like ""wow"", you know, ""they don't care"", but it only took me later to realize this internalized misogyny that I'm forcing on myself and others.",,,,
4,So what did you think feminism was before you came here?,"So before I wasn't really a feminist yet, I didn't know what it was. I had no idea that I'm disadvantaged in any type of way. And right now I've noticed that actually you know as a woman it's harder to achieve a few things. Some things of course at university level or at an entry level jobs you don't see it that much, but when you look at who are the CEOs of the biggest companies you know it's always men because you know there were men before they still recruit men and it's a cycle that it's really hard to break. But look at all the presidents of the US still no woman president. It's crazy.",,,,,
4,"I think especially here it's very prevalent like I was doing research about like how they're implementing gender inequality laws to reinforce like you know equality I guess in the workplace. But last year they had gender equality awards and all of those awards were won by men. So there was controversy because you finally have these awards and won by men. How about like your perception of like religion, like are you religious or?","So I'm agnostic I think. I was brought up Christian Orthodox like most people in my country. And I find religions beautiful because I see that power for them to unite people. But I sometimes know it's also dangerous because of people misusing it. So many of my closest friends are very religious and the community they build through it and the values they get from it is amazing. But sometimes when it's used as a political weapon, that kind of scares me and it disappoints me.",I used to be. My family is religious. They are Christian Orthodox and all of them still believe and I am departed of this since I was 13. I am a little bit more agnostic as I'm sure there's some bigger.. Higher being. There's something we don't understand. But I just disagree. I refuse to believe in religious books because I believe that's just people who wrote them.,,,,
4,Did change like after coming here and being being exposed to like so many other types of religions?,"No I think I used to be religious until I was 14 and then something happened, like I started watching documentaries and I kind of thought I ""wait a minute, doesn't really make sense to me, some things like facts"" and all that I became rebellious and all that but now I definitely have more knowledge and understanding and I see how similar all religions are. Before I had the concept that the religions are crazy different. Now I understand that they're all so similar and even the holy days happen very close to each other. I mean I understand that Islam has more of a lunar calendar and Christianity is more about the sun but it's still built around the same thing.",,,,,
4,And I think at the end it all preaches the same. I just wanna know like what did you think of like when you first heard about Ramadan?,"Ahh I was just surprised, I didn't know much about it before and I was like okay, cool, a new thing. I was really confused that in Abu Dhabi you can't drink or eat in public especially since my other Muslim friends also say that in their countries they don't have that either.",,,,,
4,"So that's like one of the things I just don't agree with. I think the whole concept of Ramadan is like feeling what the less privileged feel, and so they're not guarded. They don't have boundaries like they see other people eating other people enjoying and they just don't have expenses to like fulfill what they want either. So it really does defeat the purpose which is why I don't understand.","Yeah. And of course I believe that you should be respectful and you know we should be taught that you know always if someone's fasting be nice, don't eat in front of them. But when it's when made a law I'm just I feel it's weird.",,,,,
4,Yeah because I think it makes people uncomfortable as well. Like if someone is restricting themself from eating in front of me and like I feel bad because I. Like I'm doing this for my own purpose. Like I don't like when a whole community like especially on this campus like when the whole like NYUAD community is now restricted from eating freely in the marketplace having drinks in class like you know people have conditions they have to. Yeah. So like if you're doing it you do it for yourself. Yeah I guess I'm just gonna... What else can I ask?,You can ask about my family. You can ask about my romantic life. You can ask about my passion.,So you can ask me about my family or my career plans or the sports that I like or anything.,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,You can ask about my family or my passions or my hobbies or my fears.,You can ask me about my favorite food or my friends or my family.,You can ask me about sports that I like. Or you can ask me about...
4,Yes I think... How is your romantic life. Or like your perception of it changed from being off campus to on campus. Because I think on campus like all kinds of relationships are really like on steroids. Like the smallest like a very small conflict here just blows up and off campus like it wouldn't be that much of a deal. Like have you experienced things like these?,On campus I feel like relationships are very sped up and they become serious way quicker because you're around all the time and you accidentally almost spend way more time with a person than you should. And then people even move in with each other at the beginning. But to be honest I don't think it's a bad thing. I feel like it's just speeding up the learning process. You learn way faster. Who is not right for you.,,,,,
4,But then I feel like all those small phases in the beginning like you don't really get to experience those.,"Maybe not, but then you will be able to experience that in the future and appreciate it. Of course I don't think it's an ideal environment for creating long term relationships, but I feel like any type of learning experience is a good learning experience.",,,,,
4,So do you think the a campus being isolated on a separate island is like a good idea?,"I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea. In this context it makes sense because where else would they have built such a huge campus? They needed space I assume and then they're building a city around it right now, it will take time, but they will build it.",,,,,
4,Didn't it use to be in the city?,"It did, it did. Right? So but then they build the campus because the university needed to expand and they needed more facilities. But I am neutral about it. Some people like it some people don't. It's I feel like it's almost a half 50/50 preference rate.",,,,,
4,How about the apartments and the offices being built in front?,What do you mean?,,,,,
4,"Like how do you feel about that, like, I know you're graduating but like had you been like a freshman or like a sophomore when these offices or these apartments are built like right in front of campus like does that change things?",Why would having apartments be bad around. Is it like crowding it out?,,,,,
4,No I think it's like this campus is already very open on its own and like we already have like an endless amount of strangers coming onto campus like they's always like incidents accidents things that happen that could be prevented. And I think it's like really it's very odd I think because like being here for two years and it's like isolated and then and you can see in the near future that there are gonna be like a ton of people but always coming in and off campus.,"But I feel like it's the same thing with other universities, you know. There is some restriction of who can enter, but otherwise if it's a guest it's fine. I guess having it more closed would be weird. Because right now as well nobody can enter residences unless you're signed in. They locked out those doors on the side so nobody can sneak. The non main doors to campus entrance are mostly blocked.So I feel like they're taking that into account and doing more would be overkill.",,,,,
4,What's been the most memorable thing from being just here?,"So maybe it's because it's been so recent. But the graduation was spectacular and my family was here and saying good bye to friends and all that. I've also loved of course all the study abroad experiences, they have changed me so much.","I love being an RA! In junior year I thought I really really wanted to be an RA and I was really really hung on this idea. When I applied I was thinking about it so much and then I got it and it was exactly what I expected it to be. It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of love that comes with it because when you're there for your residents and you're supportive that kind of bounces back and gets back to you. And I just love being part of the community and being able to improve it directly.",,,,
4,Where did you go?,"I've been to New York, Buenos Aires, Paris and Shanghai.",I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I did J-terms in Paris and Shanghai.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,,,
4,Where did you go for the semester?,Buenos Aires and New York.,I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I did J-terms in Paris and Shanghai.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,,,
4,How was New York?,New York is lovely. It's my favorite place.,"I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music, both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture. It's very it's quite futuristic even though some people might say it's dirty in some places but I love that it's always awake and people aren't overly polite nor actually overly rude because Eastern Europeans are quite cold in general. So I felt like it was a great balance. And there are many many people and so many diverse people and languages and so many cultures.","New York was definitely my most favorite place on earth and that's why I hope that in the future I'll be able to go back but I will have to sort out the visa issue and all that because I have... hum, I am a citizen of Moldova which is not the European Union so it will be tough to get a visa.",,,
4,Out of all of them?,Yes. Do you want me to tell you why?,Exactly.,Yes.,,,
4,Yeah.,So I feel like New York is very lively and something is happening all the time and there is such a big diversity of people. And it's just there's always something to do. So I'd really love to live somewhere like that so that I can also achieve my ambitions with lots of energy.,"I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music, both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture.

4,Because like now it's like your postgrad period. I know we've talked about a bit but like do you actually see yourself staying in this country for a longer time?,"I do, but not forever. I don't see myself staying forever in any place ever. I just I am free bird. I would love to bring my parents here or anywhere I go but in the UAE I'd definitely stay for like five years. I love especially Dubai.",Sure!,Yes.,,,
4,I was going to ask any city specific?,Yes Dubai because Abu Dhabi is more of a family place and I don't plan to start that too soon and the other cities or Emirates are conservative. So it would be hard for me to fit in. So Dubai seems like the place.,,,,,
5,What's your name?,My name is Margarita!,I am Margarita.,"So my name is Margarita, I am from Moldova and I study music and economics.",,,
5,Nice to meet you Margarita!,Nice to meet you too!,Nice to meet you too.,Nice to meet you too,,,
5,What did you study here?,I study music and economics.,I'm a music major and economics minor.,I study music and economics. I'm a music major economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.,So I majored in music but I minored in economics. I was gonna double major.,,
5,Were they both your majors?,So I majored in music but I minored in economics. I was gonna double major.,I'm a music major and economics minor.,Oh so I am a music major and economics minor.,,,
5,But you didn't.,I didn't double major. Do you want me to tell you why?,So economics is my minor. It would have been originally a double major. But I did not have time to complete everything so I had to choose. But I mainly did economics because first of all I wanted to have a plan B. And second of all I always loved mathematics so it seemed natural that my Plan B could be something lucrative and that involves my passion.,,,,
5,What was the reason?,I was a bit behind on credits from my economics major and I was supposed to take a summer class. But I also had an internship opportunity in New York and I had to choose. So I chose the internship in New York over the major.,So economics is my minor. It would have been originally a double major. But I did not have time to complete everything so I had to choose. But I mainly did economics because first of all I wanted to have a plan B. And second of all I always loved mathematics so it seemed natural that my Plan B could be something lucrative and that involves my passion.,,,,
5,You think that was worth it?,"I think it was worth it because I took so many classes in economics that I have the knowledge and I can tell people just ""oh I studied music and economics"". I don't have to delve into what's a major and minor. People outside of this university don't know what that is anyway so as long as I have the expertise I'm not lying that I studied music and economics.",Yes.,Sure!,,,
5,So I'm assuming that you think that expertise and knowledge is more important than what there is on your transcript as if like major or minor. As long as you have the expertise that there's no real need for that major thing to be on your transcript?,Exactly. I mean the major is very important as well. But when you have more than one thing it's always better. I think of course we live in a world in which the university degree is important for your career. So that's why I'm here.,Exactly I could do anything.,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,Yes. That's why I'm studying it.,,
5,"Oh. Nice. So what do you think you'll be doing after graduation? You graduated but like say in one year, what do you think you'll be doing? What do you feel your career will look like?",I hope to maybe work in consulting. Right now I'm applying for jobs. I'm still interviewing. So maybe working in transfer pricing. Tax would also be fun.,"I'm planning to go to grad school in New York, with the only grad school I'm applying and I do not see my future in Moldova. I see myself maybe passing through from time to time to see my family and friends but I would rather bring my family my small family of four people with me abroad than have to come back home.",,,,
5,Oh good. So you're using you're drawing more on your economists knowledge than your music.,Exactly. Because I realize the music industry is not as fun as I used to thing. Every summer from freshman year until junior year I did three summers and every year I would do an internship in a better recording studio. And once I got to the pinnacle of my achievements I realized that the industry is quite messed up. So maybe in the future I'll be able to change it. But right now I don't want to participate in it. According to the rules that are set now.,Exactly.,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,,,
5,Oh OK. What do you think you'll be doing in 10 years?,"In 10 years I hope to have my own business. I definitely want to contribute to the world in a way, I am very passionate about climate change, overpopulation issues, philanthropy in general. So I hope to be a businesswoman and have an impact on the world.",I was thinking of getting an MBA - Masters of Business Administration - so I could combine my music and econ knowledge and hopefully restructure the music industry of Moldova in the future. So an MBA would help me a lot.,,,,
5,So you came here four years ago of as a freshman. Do you think... Do you think you accomplished or got to where you wanted to be or the goals you set before you came here?,"Yes. Actually I think so. It's a crazy thing. In the freshman year we were all made to write a letter to your senior self and I was shocked to see how many of the things that I've already done were actually in the back of my mind and I mentioned them! I was like ""woah l I actually did all these things"", but I did even more than I expected of myself. But you know it feels like sometimes when you reach a certain point you almost feel like ""oh I could have done better"". So even though technically I did everything I want to do I still feel like there's room for improvement.",,,,,
5,Okay. Okay. If you repeated your four years of NYUAD what would you change?,I would have taken a computer science class earlier. Literally I would have taken it in my freshman year. Maybe I would have made it my minor or my major. I took it in my junior year and that was quite late.,,,,,
5,So that's one thing.,Yes. And definitely I would have repeated the same mistakes because I've learned from my mistakes.,,,,,
5,What made you come to NYUAD in the first place?,"So my brother knew another Moldovan student that was going here. And he was graduating and it was my time to apply so he was in Moldova in my home country and I was there too, so I was able to ask him all this question and he told me that this university gives you a full scholarship and that the people are so amazing here. And that the education is good quality, you get to travel and that the UAE is super safe. He broke all the stereotypes so it seemed like the place for me and it's an American institution, it's in English and I really wanted to study abroad.","My brother used to know somebody who went here because they went through the same exchange program and actually my brother wanted to go here first, but my parents were afraid of the situation in the Middle East. As religious Eastern European middle aged parents they did not know that much about the Middle East and they were worried about their kids, but once that guy graduated and it was my time to fly I got to ask him all the questions and I knew that it's safe and it's actually a great place to be so...",,,,
5,Okay. OK. What would you look like had you not come to NYUAD?,"Oh I don't even want to think about it cause my whole identity revolves about having grown in these for years at NYUAD and all these countries where I've been through this crazy university. I feel like maybe I would have been somewhere in Romania because that's a go to for a lot of Moldovan students. Maybe studying something like languages. Being an interpreter, translator, maybe studying law. Maybe being somewhere in Europe, but definitely I would not stay in Moldova.",,,,,
5,Okay so you wanted to come out of your country.,"Yes. I've been in the U.S. for an exchange year before for one year and I loved that, so after I finished high school I wanted to replicate that.",Yes. I've actually had an exchange year abroad before Abu Dhabi. I've been... I lived in Wisconsin for a year and after studying at NYU Abu Dhabi I got a chance to study abroad in Buenos Aires and New York for a semester each and then I did a month in Paris and a month in Shanghai.,,,,
5,Well. What was the reason for you not to stay in your country or want to go out?,"Moldova is the poorest country in Europe by GDP per capita and there are limited opportunities. And because of that people are also kind of miserable and because of that they're not that polite and they're not that optimistic and you know it's an environment that I didn't want to be in. The people are lovely but the socio-economic situation is so bad. It's not an environment you can blossom in. And my parents since I was very young they instilled this idea ""you're going to leave, you're going to go to a better place and then in the end you're going to take us with you"". So it was never even in my mind to stay, ever. But now I'm having these ideas that maybe in the future I should come back and actually make a change because now I'm becoming less selfish and thinking only about my family. I know that I'll be able to support my family. I'm very confident that I'll be successful. So I'm like, ""hmm maybe now I can be also meaningful as opposed to only successful"".",The thing is Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. So you could say that I am from a hardcore developing country and I lived most of my life there. So my grandma doesn't even have a toilet. You just go behind the house and I'm so comfortable with that. If I was ever to become rich and then lose everything I wouldn't be even close to depressed because I know what it's like to start from nothing. So I'm lucky you could say.,,,,
5,OK. So do you envision yourself going back to your country as part of your professional career?,Maybe in the future. Not now for sure. But maybe in ten years. Yes.,,,,,
5,OK. Do you think there is such a thing as giving back to your country or do you feel like a responsibility to go back and give back to your country? Personally?,"I personally have that responsibility, but I don't feel like everybody should feel that way. In the end it's like we're living on one planet and you can make home anywhere you go. And the only thing that differentiates us really from the other people in other countries is where you're born and that's it. So every country is trying to take care of their citizens but some are failing and I feel like it's almost a little bit of propaganda. The governments are trying instill so that people don't leave their country if they don't like it. That you know that you should stay and give back. I mean if if a country is doing nice things for you... What is a country? It's like if the community is doing nice things for you and loves you at least, is trying to push you up, then of course you feel a sense of duty that you should give back, but nobody owes anyone anything just because they were born in a certain spot. That's what I believe.",,,,,
5,OK. OK. So it's out of niceness of your heart.,"That's nice of you to say. I'd love to believe that I'm kind and altruistic. I don't know if... I don't know if I'm altruistic, you know, there's actually this debate that even altruism can be selfish because maybe you're just doing it so that you feel better or maybe you're doing it for the image of it or maybe... I don't know. I'd like to believe that I'm kind and that I'm driven by this set of values that isn't selfish. I would love to believe that.",,,,,
5,What about your parents? You said they always wanted you to go outside of your country and then take them with you later. How else do you think they have influenced you as part of growing up?,"So lately I've been thinking that my mother specifically is so empathetic and that it's not normal for everyone to be so empathetic. I didn't know she's so special until I saw other moms. And she's a doctor as well. So I think she's indirectly taught me empathy. She never said ""oh, you must be empathetic"". She just showed it to me. And now I'm like that too so I really care. My dad has taught me generosity. Every time I would ask for something like ten dollars, he's gonna give me 15. I swear to God he always does that and he gets so much pleasure out of it. And I definitely want to be like that too because I'm a little bit think stingy with my money I guess because of my financial insecurity, like I want to be secure. But I want to be generous and kind. And my brother is very very ambitious and he's five years older and I'm taking after him.","Oh so my mom keeps telling me ""first get a career and then family"". She's like from my very childhood she kept saying that. She says she doesn't want me to depend on anyone. Lately I've been also kind of all these weird ideologies to my mom because I'm like sooner or later she has to find out but my alternative lifestyle of thinking ""maybe not having kids"" or ""maybe having kids"". Not saying that I'm not going to have kids. But I'm saying there's a possibility, mom. My self-worth is not equal, is not determined by whether I have kids. And she's kind of getting used to this idea. But she's really hoping that it's a phase and it will go away.","I love my mom. She is actually surprisingly a close friend to me. She's way more open minded than most of the moms that I know at this age and growing up in such a conservative country. And she's very empathetic and she's very very kind. So I kind of learned that from her as a second hand effect. She never preached it to me. So I really admire her and love her and I just want to find a way to pay her back somehow. But she also loves control and it's sometimes annoying, when she's like ""put on some makeup"" and I'm like ""No I'm beautiful this way"".",,,
5,How many siblings do you have?,I have one older brother.,I have a brother.,I have a sibling. He is five years older. He is a computer scientist and he lives in Moldova.,"Sooo... my family consists of four people. Me, my mom, my dad, and an older brother. And yes I have a sibling. He's five years older than me and he is a computer scientist and he is still in Moldova.","So my family consists of four people. It's my mom, my dad and my brother. My brother is five years older and he is a computer scientist and he's in Moldova right now.",
5,Five years older you say?,Yes he's five years older. He is a software engineer. He is also trying to build his company although in Moldova that's really hard. So he might have to readapt and maybe go back into the job market. But yes right now he's left his job to try to start a company.,Exactly.,Yes.,,,
5,In Moldova?,Yes.,,,,,
5,OK! If you could describe your country in a few short sentences. What would you say?,So Moldova has a great climate. We have four seasons. It's amazing because we speak two languages from the very get go. And we have really hot girls.,"In Moldova we have all types of weather. We have four seasons and it gets from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40. So we have a huge range and we experience all seasons - Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. So I miss that.",Moldova borders Romania and Ukraine. And Moldova... We used to be part of Romania before it was also colonized by Russia and then we got united back to Romania and then was kind of the Soviet Union. So now we do speak both Romanian and Russian.,So Moldova is a tiny country landlocked between Romania and Ukraine and it used to be part of Romania as well as part of the Soviet Union later. So now we speak two languages - Romanian and Russian.,,
5,What else can we ask you?,"You can ask me about my passions, you can ask me about my family, you can ask me about preferences in food, in countries. You can ask me about my friends, you can ask me about my fears, anything.",So you can ask me about my family or my career plans or the sports that I like or anything.,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,You can ask me about my favorite food or my friends or my family.,You can ask me about sports that I like. Or you can ask me about...,
5,What would you miss most about NYUAD?,"So as the graduation speaker said after this university being in such a diverse environment where people are so accepting and nice and intelligent, after you go out in the world there's not such a concentrated community of this type of people anymore. So I'm actually terrified of that. I don't know. I'll really miss being surrounded by spectacular, brilliant people all the time. And I'll miss my friends a lot. And I think I'll miss studying as well. I love studying. But I'm also tired of it. I want to go into the world, but I know I'll miss it.","Oh I don't even want to think about it cause my whole identity revolves about having grown in these for years at NYUAD and all these countries where I've been through this crazy university. I feel like maybe I would have been somewhere in Romania because that's a go to for a lot of Moldovan students. Maybe studying something like languages. Being an interpreter, translator, maybe studying law. Maybe being somewhere in Europe, but definitely I would not stay in Moldova.","I feel like I've grown so much at NYUAD. I've also grown accustomed to meeting good quality people all the time. And I feel so privileged to have all the resources both on campus and to travel abroad and learn there. So I feel like I've grown so much, but I also feel really grateful because it feels like it's not my merit. I feel like I'm very blessed.",,,
5,OK. OK. So you'll miss studying.,Yeah. That's crazy. But can you imagine not having to worry about food then getting to travel and just you know just enriching your knowledge. Messing around. Yeah.,Exactly.,"Haha! Exactly, you heard me well.",,,
5,Where did you take your study away semester?,I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I did J-terms in Paris and Shanghai.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,Buenos Aires and New York.,,,
5,Oh nice. What was the most interesting or your most enjoyable course you took at NYUAD?,Do you mean just at the NYUAD campus or across?,Mmm. I think. My favorite class would be the one that I took at Stern in New York. Which is Negotiation and Consensus Building. It's a class about how to get what you want while still building relationships and giving the other side somewhat of a fair share. So leaving everyone satisfied while getting what you want. Unless you want me to tell you a favorite class in NYU Abu Dhabi?,"I took one Intro to Computer Science class. I studied a little bit of Python and that was great, but I had to pass fail the class because I wasn't doing as great as I thought I would. My brother's a computer scientist as well.",,,
5,"Overall, across.",My favorite course was a negotiation and consensus building in New York and fundamentals of acting in Abu Dhabi.,Mmm. I think. My favorite class would be the one that I took at Stern in New York. Which is Negotiation and Consensus Building. It's a class about how to get what you want while still building relationships and giving the other side somewhat of a fair share. So leaving everyone satisfied while getting what you want. Unless you want me to tell you a favorite class in NYU Abu Dhabi?,,,,
5,"Oh okay. What was it about one of those courses, negotiations say, that you liked.","I loved about negotiation that it teaches you how to get what you want without screwing over the other person. So getting the best outcome for you while also building the relationship and making sure that you know to negotiate ethically, a little bit of ethics in there. But also, you know, how to make a conflict into an opportunity. And that you don't have to be, you know, assertive and an angry negotiator to get good results. And that sometimes the things we ask for is not necessarily what we need. Like there's a an interest behind them. And so basically how to navigate that. So basically you can negotiate job salaries, you can negotiate which movie you watch with a friend, you can negotiate with your mom who you're gonna marry. Anything anything.",,,,,
6,So is this your natural hair color?,"I love it when people ask that question because it means it doesn't look too fake. No, my hair color is brown and I've been dying like this since I was 14.",So I started to dye my hair red when I was 14.,,,,
6,"I love the dedication. I love your, hair looks great.",Thank you.,Thank you!,Thanks,,,
6,So where were you raised?,So I was born and raised in Moldova. I've been for a year as an exchange student in the US during my high school. But that's about it.,So I'm originally from Moldova which is an Eastern European country. It's between Romania and Ukraine and I've lived most of my life there.,I am from Moldova. It's a small country in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine.,,,
6,Where in the US?,Wisconsin.,I went to Wisconsin.,,,,
6,OK.,"There was a program that gave you a state randomly, so you couldn't choose.",Oh yeah.,Yeah!,,,
6,Oh my God. That could have been. That's wild. And do you miss home when you're here in Abu Dhabi?,"Oh I do. I sometimes do, but not to the point to be like, ""oh I want to go back and live there"". No. I miss the people from my home and I do miss a little bit of the nature. We have this really cool cherry tree at my house that I spent my childhood climbing.",,,,,
6,I love that.,"Yeah. There's cherries at the end of May. Like right now probably, but I'm not there.",Thank you!,Thanks,,,
6,When are you heading back home?,I'm going to go home at the end of July.,,,,,
6,What made you take this class in particular?,So right now I'm doing a PPTP which is a program for people who have just graduated. I graduated three days ago. That's crazy. And so this is basically a transition into the real world because I'm doing research with a professor right now.,What do you mean?,I am quite busy. I am working on the PPTP program with Nizar and Alberto and that's why I'm here right now.,,,
6,OK. That's really cool. Who's the professor?,So it's Nizar.,,,,,
6,Ohhh I love Nizar! Yeah sorry. What would you like to do in the future? What's life past PPTP?,"I'm applying for jobs right now. I would love to do either consulting or transfer pricing, which is the area in tax. So I would love to stay here and work in Dubai preferably, otherwise if in two months it doesn't work out then it's probably for the best, there's probably something else and I'll go back to Moldova and look for jobs in Europe.","I think the MBA would give me a chance to do anything I want in the future. Because I just specialized into a field, in music, and I've done some economics as well. So I feel like I have enough quantitative knowledge to jump into an MBA but also it will help me use my music knowledge into creating maybe a business or solidify the music industry of Moldova.",,,,
6,OK. All right. Why would you want to stay in Dubai?,"Because the Sheikh's plan worked and I started loving this place and Abu Dhabi is a bit more family oriented and I don't plan to start one too soon and Dubai is a bit more wild and more accepting towards people like me, who dress up like me, who behave like me.","I would love for it to be New York. I would love to settle down in New York, but of course getting an American work visa is quite hard, not being a citizen there. So right now I'd love to work in Dubai even though I'm applying for jobs in Abu Dhabi as well. So in the next few years I would love to be in the the UAE and then we'll see.",,,,
6,No I totally hear you. I feel much more comfortable in Dubai as well. I don't think people care as much. OK.,A lot of tourists in Dubai right? Expats.,Exactly.,,,,
6,Back to the hair. What drew you to this color?,"I don't know, I guess I like attention. I mean many people in my family are either blonde or ginger or something and then I got brown so I felt like it's unfair. So I went for something different. Yeah. My dad has black hair and my mom is super blonde, her hair was like almost white in her childhood.","Why did I dye my hair red. So I guess I like attention. I have been dying it since I was 14 and I just decided that my brown hair doesn't stand out much. I don't have any crazy prominent features so I was like ""I'll dye my hair red"". A lot of people in my family are either blond or red headed. So it kind of felt unfair that I got brown, you know, so I was like I'm gonna stand out.",,,,
6,So you've got Brown. Yeah black hair is really uncommon as well. What do you think? These are such random questions.,That's great. That's great.,That's great. That's great.,,,,
6,What drew you to this keyboard set? I love flowers so I'm just curious.,"So I wanted a keyboard cover because if you spill something that protects your keyboard. But I just thought it looks really pretty and flowery, I like flowers, and although it kind of covers the letters I don't look at the letters anymore so I think it's even cooler. I mean my mom who doesn't type fast was really annoyed with my keyboard, she was like ""I have to look for letters now"". But I was like ""I don't even look"".",,,,,
6,OK. You earlier mentioned that you're not interested in starting a family soon. Do you imagine yourself having a family in the future?,I could have a family in the future because I have very strong maternal instincts. I love babies and I love giving love and care to other people. So I'd be a great mom. At the same time I care about sustainability issues and the issues of overpopulation so I need to be sure that first of all I am intelligent enough to teach them how to be sustainable and all that but also make the decision of whether I want to adopt or. Just all these things you know. Like I don't know I see literally myself both having kids and not having kids in the future.,"So, first of all I don't want to rush it. Whatever the reason is, I want to make sure I build a family with the exactly right person, because I'd rather be single than with the wrong person. And I see it all around me - parents of my friends divorcing and all families having problems. So I want I want to be more cautious. Another thing is the issue of overpopulation. I want to make sure I contribute with a new kid at the right time and that I have the right resources and I'm already old enough to also teach my children how to live sustainably, and since I don't want to have many children, one or two maximum, I don't feel like there's a rush.",,,,
6,Me too. Mostly not. Yes. OK. What else can I ask about?,You can ask about my family or my passions or my hobbies or my fears.,So you can ask me about my family or my career plans or the sports that I like or anything.,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,You can ask about my family or my passions or my hobbies or my fears.,You can ask me about my favorite food or my friends or my family.,You can ask me about sports that I like. Or you can ask me about...
6,That's a good list. How did your parents meet?,Wow that's cute. My parents met at a wedding. So they were friends of a groom and one was a friend of the bride. And they met there and they started talking and then things went wild. Yeah.,,,,,
6,I thought you meant they met at their wedding as if it was an arranged marriage.,"That's not a thing in Eastern Europe. You were forced to marry as soon as possible in the beginning, back in the days. Right now it's different. But my mom's generation was almost guilted into marrying as soon as possible. At least in college, if you went to college, because it's like after college all the good ones are gone or like you're getting too old and ""what if you aren't able to get kids""? It's a bit crazy.",,,,,
6,Yeah and so what do your parents want for you? Do you know?,"Oh so my mom keeps telling me ""first get a career and then family"". She's like from my very childhood she kept saying that. She says she doesn't want me to depend on anyone. Lately I've been also kind of all these weird ideologies to my mom because I'm like sooner or later she has to find out but my alternative lifestyle of thinking ""maybe not having kids"" or ""maybe having kids"". Not saying that I'm not going to have kids. But I'm saying there's a possibility, mom. My self-worth is not equal, is not determined by whether I have kids. And she's kind of getting used to this idea. But she's really hoping that it's a phase and it will go away.","Not exactly, none of my parents like ... or do anything in music per se. They had some musical education, but not much. And my my dad's kinda working in the law, my mom's a doctor, my brother is doing CS and so I just basically have a broad family. I'm very interested in negotiating.",,,,
6,Oh yeah. Yep. Sounds familiar. So alternative lifestyle in the sense of children only or also sexuality?,"Yeah. That as well. Yeah I mean I am bisexual but I don't go too loud about it. I am still afraid of being judged even though my letter from the LGBTQ is I feel the most privileged and easiest to hide, and to pretend that you're straight. But still at home people are quite judgmental.",Exactly.,,,,
6,OK. So you're worried about it back home. But not on campus I hope.,"Not on campus. No, not lately especially because most of the time I also have been in denial so I wasn't telling people cause I was thinking, ""am I just trying to be cool?"". Like am I for real or am I just trying to embrace everything weird that I can think about. But I found out later that I think it's a thing. Exactly I was.",,,,,
6,Yeah you're speaking to the treasurer of anchorage group. I've been Treasurer for a year. Yeah. OK. So. You mentioned a cherry tree. Cherry tree? Cherry tomatoes?,Yeah you're right! Cherry tree.,"Yeah. There's cherries at the end of May. Like right now probably, but I'm not there.",,,,
6,What other childhood memories do you cherish?,"So I think the snow cause we had a lot of snow during winter and we'd go down a hill with a sleigh. We have a lot of hills in Moldova. And also going caroling. Right now it's not a thing anymore because people, you know, people have internet and they see all these crazy things in the media and they think that the world has become more dangerous when actually the few cases that are messed up are just very publicized in the media and people think ""oh no, this happens all the time, I shouldn't let my kids go alone at night caroling at random houses"". But I remember that back in my childhood our community was like a very tight knit, like a village. Everyone knew each other and we'd go and it was so fun and so pure and innocent.",,,,,
6,"OK so caroling, Christmas.","Yes, Christmas as well. Yeah. I remember my parents lying about Santa and me being like ""Yo I'm not that dumb. I've been told. My kindergarten friend said...""",,,,,
6,Oh that's amazing. And what are your hobbies today? Or some of your favorite?,So I like rock climbing and I like biking. Basically all sports that don't involve going to the gym. And I like reading although I should be reading more. And I love singing. That's just so natural. I'm not saying I'm great. I just like it.,I love drawing sometimes but abstract basically that link. I loved volleyball and biking a lot and I am very interested in negotiation as a science and the aspects of communication.,"Sure! I love rock climbing and I love biking. I love reading, although I should do it more often. And basically I like all sports that don't involve going to the gym.",,,
6,"OK. Have you had a chance to sing in any events on campus? I feel like I might have seen you, but I'm not sure.","Sometimes. I sometimes sing at open mikes but not that often. Because I guess I'm such a perfectionist that I don't get things done sometimes. You know it's taking a toll, it's like ""oh but I'm not still ready yet to sing the song. So maybe next time cause I'm busy"". But. Sometimes. Sometimes I sing.",,,,,
6,And what kind of reading do you like to do?,"So I really like science fiction. But at the same time lately it almost feels like a waste of time, which is not true. But it makes me feel like I should be reading books that teach me about life. So books from economists about what's happening in the world or psychology books about understanding people more as opposed to just improving my vocabulary and my imagination with science fiction.",I read all the Divergent books. They're pretty cool. Ender's Game was pretty cool.,"My favorite book is probably ""Bargaining for advantage"" by... hum.. I'm bad with names so I won't remember that. But it is basically a book that talks about how to protect your interests when you talk to somebody while still leaving the other person happy. So basically getting what you want while actually satisfying the other person as well and building relationships.",,,
6,Do you have a particular favorite?,I read all the Divergent books. They're pretty cool. Ender's Game was pretty cool.,"My favorite book is probably ""Bargaining for advantage"" by... hum.. I'm bad with names so I won't remember that. But it is basically a book that talks about how to protect your interests when you talk to somebody while still leaving the other person happy. So basically getting what you want while actually satisfying the other person as well and building relationships.",,,,
6,What's that?,"So. I don't remember it very well. The plot is basically about space and how this little boy was basically in the academy in space and you know it's in the future basically. There are already multiple planets discovered with life and all that, and basically stuff goes wrong and this little guy goes and saves them. He's like very smart but not accepted by his peers. Kind of like that.",What do you mean?,,,,
6,OK. I think I would have loved to read that at one point in the phase in which I read Divergent series and Hunger Games. What did you graduate in?,Oh so I am a music major and economics minor.,I'm a music major and economics minor.,I study music and economics. I'm a music major economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.,So I majored in music but I minored in economics. I was gonna double major.,,
6,Oh OK. I would have expected maybe the other way around based on what you wanted to do in the future.,"Yes. My music was my passion all of my life and it felt like almost I owed to myself to study it. But also economics, so I was trying to double major. But I was behind on credits and something. But I feel like that I've taken so many classes that I am qualified.",So I'm actually not double majoring. I'm majoring in music and minoring in economics. I was going to double major. But I love both fields a lot and I couldn't decide between them. So I decided to study both.,,,,
6,OK. Yeah. Alright. Cool. And what kind of music do you like or do you perform anything or do you play a particular instrument?,So I like all types of music. I love electronic music and classical music and pop music. And I do like performing. But I'm more of a composer and sound engineer. And also I play piano and flute and a bit of cello and ukulele.,"I play the piano and a little bit of ukulele and cello and I've been playing flute for a year. I do sing but mostly in music I am... I consider myself a composer and a sound engineer as well so making both songs, lyrics and music, and making music for film.",I love all types of music. I feel like it depends on the piece. I love dubstep. I love electronic music. I also like ballads like the music that I write usually comes out very sad and romantic and like pop songs. So the music I write and the music I listen to are quite different.,,,
7,Hi. Nice to meet you.,Nice to meet you too!,Nice to meet you too.,Nice to meet you too,,,
7,So tell me more about yourself. What did you study?,"So my name is Margarita, I am from Moldova and I study music and economics.",I study music and economics. I'm a music major economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.,I study music and economics.,I study music and economics. So in music I study composition and technology and economics is just my minor.,,
7,Nice. Do you like music and economics?,Yes. That's why I'm studying it.,,,,,
7,Why do you like music and economics?,"So music was my passion for most of my life. And economics is just another thing that... I wanted to do something smart as well, not just artsy. And since I love maths I thought economics was the best thing. I'd never done economics before so I had no idea what it is.",,,,,
7,And did economics turn out to be the best thing?,It turned out to be a good thing. Maybe I wish I had taken computer science classes before. But it's OK. I graduated by the way so I don't regret any of my decisions.,Sure!,,,,
7,Congratulations!,Thank you.,Thank you!,Thanks,,,
7,So were you born and raised in Moldova?,Yes.,So I was born and raised in Moldova. I've been for a year as an exchange student in the US during my high school. But that's about it.,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,,,
7,You've spent your entire life before coming to NYUAD there. So how was Moldova like?,"Moldova is very interesting. It's a post-Soviet country. It used to be part of Romania. It borders Romania and Ukraine only, it's landlocked. No mountains, just hills and rivers. But people are very nice, but it's the poorest country in Europe so they're kind of depressed. And sometimes they can be short tempered. Because the socio-economic situation is so harsh. So I always had the dream to get out and go somewhere else for my studies and my career.","In Moldova we have all types of weather. We have four seasons and it gets from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40. So we have a huge range and we experience all seasons - Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. So I miss that.","So Moldova used to be part of Romania and the Russia - Soviet Union. So the foods are combined from all over the place. We have some Romanian food. We have some Russian food. I feel like even some Turkish things were combined in there and so we eat a lot of soups and we eat a lot of grains like rice as well, but cooked and not bland white. And the western food is everywhere.",So Moldova has a great climate. We have four seasons. It's amazing because we speak two languages from the very get go. And we have really hot girls.,The thing is Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. So you could say that I am from a hardcore developing country and I lived most of my life there. So my grandma doesn't even have a toilet. You just go behind the house and I'm so comfortable with that. If I was ever to become rich and then lose everything I wouldn't be even close to depressed because I know what it's like to start from nothing. So I'm lucky you could say.,
7,Why did you choose NYUAD?,"My brother had a friend. And he studied here and when he graduated it was my time to choose a university and I talked to him and he told me that it's so wonderful and it's an American education, so it's in English and it's a full scholarship. And the weather's great and I learned that there are so many opportunities and it's safe. So it was a no brainer since I wanted to go abroad.","I feel like I've grown so much at NYUAD. I've also grown accustomed to meeting good quality people all the time. And I feel so privileged to have all the resources both on campus and to travel abroad and learn there. So I feel like I've grown so much, but I also feel really grateful because it feels like it's not my merit. I feel like I'm very blessed.",,,,
7,And did you regret it once you came to NYUAD?,"No I think it was the best decision I could do in my entire life. I didn't expect that I would think that, that I'd be so grateful. But, like, when I was coming here I knew it's good, but I wasn't sure, it was one of the options, I guess, in my mind. But definitely the opportunities that we get here and the quality of people is so high. And it's just a wonderful environment to study and grow.","No, definitely not. Of course we don't have that many people as the New York campus for example or any other campus. But the quality of people here is so high and I don't think it's that hard to meet new people. It depends on what you like as well and for some people it's suffocating to date someone here because you accidentally see that person all the time and you don't get your private space. But in terms of meeting new people, I think this university is really good because people are nice.",,,,
7,How many people are in your family?,"There's four people. There's my mom, my dad, my older brother, and me.","So my family consists of four people. It's my mom, my dad and my brother. My brother is five years older and he is a computer scientist and he's in Moldova right now.",,,,
7,How do you like to be the younger child?,"Well I love it because I kind of got more attention, because I love attention. But because I'm a girl I wasn't allowed to go out with as late and all that. But I was still lucky that my brother got to go abroad first so that I was allowed to go alone abroad as well. You know, especially to an Arab country, which my brother wasn't allowed to do. And then I grew up five years later and then I talked to his friends who graduated by then. And that's when I realized that all the preconceptions about the Middle East aren't entirely true. Especially about the UAE.",That's great. That's great.,,,,
7,How's it like to grow up as a woman in Moldova?,"Well at first sight it's normal and... people in Moldova would be very confused by this question. But now that I went abroad and I know what feminism is and all that I can see that there's not equal opportunities, although women now are expected to work as well because people are like ""oh equality, right? women should work"". There's not actually the same attitude about house chores and who takes care of the kids. So it's crazy although over time the responsibilities of men went down, the amount of them, like they don't have to hunt for food anymore right. They don't have to. They just go to the office now and it's good. But now women have doubled their responsibilities, cause they still have to make the food, they still have to clean the house. You still have to raise the kids. But also they now do what men do, and go to the office. So it's crazy. Yeah. So I feel like it's very similar in many, many places around the world. But of course it's more so in conservative countries.",,,,,
7,What's your least favorite part about NYUAD?,"My least favorite part about NYUAD is the fact that when we study abroad it's harder to maintain relationships. And you find that people keep studying abroad at different times. So you could not see your friend maybe for a whole year and a half because you keep studying in different places at different times. So it's very hard to maintain good relationship, but at the same time because there are not that many people at this university and it's such a tight knit community, that's kind of equalized by that, you know, like, there's a balance cause then you come back and then you see them all the time.",,,,,
7,Where would you like to live other than the places where you've already lived in?,"Wow that's an amazing question. So I guess I would definitely like to go to New Zealand and check it out. It's first of all so far away and people seem really open minded and nice there and especially with the news with the attacks, the way they've dealt with it is just beautiful. I'd love to be part of the community that's so caring and open minded and considerate about minorities as well. That sounds cool, but I'm not going to actively work towards it. You know it's really hard. It's not like a dream of mine. I'm just saying if I were to choose a place in which I haven't been, I'd go there.",My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,New York City is definitely my favorite place. Do you want me to tell you why?,,,
7,Do you have any dreams?,"Do I have any dreams? Sure. I feel my biggest dream is to make enough money so that I can give my parents anything they want so that they can travel more and bring them wherever I go. And then afterwards I do want to do something that's impactful on the world. Maybe do some philanthropy, open my own company, because otherwise I don't see meaning in life. I'm not saying everyone should do that. For some people the meaning of life is to find happiness. For me happiness will come from meaning, you know finding a purpose in life bla bla. I guess I was brainwashed by this university to actually do the things that I said on my application.","I feel like you during my younger years now until my 30s at least I want of city that's very alive and burning and hustling. But later on I'll prefer a countryside. By the way you're welcome to ask more personal questions if you want. Not only circumstantial, but also things that you would ask someone who you are already close with, you know? You can ask anything. Just remind so you know.",,,,
7,You said you wanted to open your own company. What kind of company would you want to open?,"So it would be either a music company, something to help out the music industry in Moldova, maybe a streaming service kind of like Spotify cause at home streaming really is not a thing. Piracy is a big issue. Or I would do anything else that's innovative. For example you know how right now there is an issue about the visibility of menstrual cups. And they're very healthy and very sustainable and just wonderful. So maybe something like that. You know, something that would be groundbreaking in the country.","I think the MBA would give me a chance to do anything I want in the future. Because I just specialized into a field, in music, and I've done some economics as well. So I feel like I have enough quantitative knowledge to jump into an MBA but also it will help me use my music knowledge into creating maybe a business or solidify the music industry of Moldova.",,,,
7,Tell me more about you as a child.,"Attention seeking child. Really loud, very energetic. Mean sometimes, but I didn't know that. I thought that was the best. I was the smartest one in my kindergarten but then I was given to a school of smart kids. Then I suddenly was average. So my ego normalized. My confidence dropped to normal levels. And yeah. I think I was cute and funny.",,,,,
7,Tell me about your brother as a child.,"Oh he was shy I think. I think he was the shy one. More study oriented. He was also very proper kid. He liked to follow rules and since he had me who was younger he felt very protective. So that was very cute but also he was not very affectionate when he was a kid. I was like ""oh give me a kiss give me a kiss"" and him being five years older he'd be like ""ew, no, go away"". But later on that changed with time. Now he's affectionate as well.",,,,,
7,Tell me more about your relationship with your mom.,"I love my mom. She is actually surprisingly a close friend to me. She's way more open minded than most of the moms that I know at this age and growing up in such a conservative country. And she's very empathetic and she's very very kind. So I kind of learned that from her as a second hand effect. She never preached it to me. So I really admire her and love her and I just want to find a way to pay her back somehow. But she also loves control and it's sometimes annoying, when she's like ""put on some makeup"" and I'm like ""No I'm beautiful this way"".","So lately I've been thinking that my mother specifically is so empathetic and that it's not normal for everyone to be so empathetic. I didn't know she's so special until I saw other moms. And she's a doctor as well. So I think she's indirectly taught me empathy. She never said ""oh, you must be empathetic"". She just showed it to me. And now I'm like that too so I really care. My dad has taught me generosity. Every time I would ask for something like ten dollars, he's gonna give me 15. I swear to God he always does that and he gets so much pleasure out of it. And I definitely want to be like that too because I'm a little bit think stingy with my money I guess because of my financial insecurity, like I want to be secure. But I want to be generous and kind. And my brother is very very ambitious and he's five years older and I'm taking after him.","Oh so my mom keeps telling me ""first get a career and then family"". She's like from my very childhood she kept saying that. She says she doesn't want me to depend on anyone. Lately I've been also kind of all these weird ideologies to my mom because I'm like sooner or later she has to find out but my alternative lifestyle of thinking ""maybe not having kids"" or ""maybe having kids"". Not saying that I'm not going to have kids. But I'm saying there's a possibility, mom. My self-worth is not equal, is not determined by whether I have kids. And she's kind of getting used to this idea. But she's really hoping that it's a phase and it will go away.",,,
7,Like all moms.,Yeah!,Exactly.,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,,,
7,Tell me more about your relationship with your dad.,"Yeah. My dad is also a cute person. He keeps offering to make me tea all the time. And he always gives me more than I ask. Like if I ask for ten dollars he's gonna give me 15. This is just so nice, always. He just gets positive energy from that. But sometimes we have different views on life and we don't agree, but we just we don't push it on each other. That's the lovely thing. We don't push each other's ideas on each other.",,,,,
7,What's his view on life and what's your view on life?,"He's very conservative. He's also religious. And I'm none of that. And yeah he was upset that I would go out like at 11:00 p.m. now as an adult at a university to have tea with a friend, he'd be like ""it's 11:00. Where do you think you're going?"" I was like ""excuse you, I was studying in a foreign country for four years by myself and I did whatever I want and now I have to come at 11?"" And so kind of like that. But I know it's because he loves me.","So I'm agnostic I think. I was brought up Christian Orthodox like most people in my country. And I find religions beautiful because I see that power for them to unite people. But I sometimes know it's also dangerous because of people misusing it. So many of my closest friends are very religious and the community they build through it and the values they get from it is amazing. But sometimes when it's used as a political weapon, that kind of scares me and it disappoints me.",,,,
7,Do you have any pets?,I have a dog at home and I have cats. I'm not that close cause I'm not home all the time. My parents are close to the pets. But I'd love to have a cat in the future. I'm a cat person.,,,,,
7,Would you like to have a baby in the future?,"That's surprisingly frequent question that comes up. Perhaps, because I have very strong maternal instincts and I love taking care of someone. And I care a lot. But at the same time there's the overpopulation issue, the sustainability issue, you know. So I'm kind of 50/50. In the future we'll wait and see. Even adoption is an option in my mind. But of course it's nice to have at least one kid that you created in your life, hmm I'm kinda curious what's gonna happen. What's it going to look like? It's going to act like?",I could have a family in the future because I have very strong maternal instincts. I love babies and I love giving love and care to other people. So I'd be a great mom. At the same time I care about sustainability issues and the issues of overpopulation so I need to be sure that first of all I am intelligent enough to teach them how to be sustainable and all that but also make the decision of whether I want to adopt or. Just all these things you know. Like I don't know I see literally myself both having kids and not having kids in the future.,,,,
7,What's your favorite place in Abu Dhabi?,My favorite place in Abu Dhabi? I think this campus.,,,,,
7,Other than this campus?,"I like walking along the waterside next to Marina Mall. I think that's a very beautiful place to walk around at night. I like, eating wise, I love going to Chinese HotPot.",,,,,
7,If there was one social issue you could change in this world what would it be.,"There's so many, there's so many. The one that's most important to meI think it would be the environmental change for us because I feel like the clock is ticking. The other things aren't more fair, like I don't know, sexism, racism, they're not any less urgent. But they're not finite, whereas the planet is finite and I feel like we need to act now.",I really love the environment and I really try to live sustainably. Doesn't always work because of the products that are available. Sometimes you can't help it if you need a product that's wrapped in plastic. And you have no choice. But I really love the environment. I just got a tattoo of a tree on my my back as well. A pine tree. I just feel like the Earth is so beautiful that we have to take care of it. And that's another reason why I'm not rushing with having a family. Because I feel like climate change would impact so much the lives of our children that I want to be mindful whether I want to bring another child into this world. If the world's not seeming like it's going to a good direction.,,,,
8,"I guess I'll start with ""where are you from""? Where did you grow up?",Speak up by the way. So I am from Moldova. I was born and raised there and my only deviation was going to the US for an exchange year in my high school.,So I'm originally from Moldova which is an Eastern European country. It's between Romania and Ukraine and I've lived most of my life there.,I am from Moldova. It's a small country in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine.,"I'm from Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe.",,
8,Where in the US did you go?,I went to Wisconsin.,My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,Wisconsin.,,,
8,That's crazy. Why Wisconsin?,Because it was a random place that they gave me. That was part of the program that you don't get to choose.,"There was a program that gave you a state randomly, so you couldn't choose.",,,,
8,OK. And did you enjoy Wisconsin? How was that experience compared to coming here as part of this American institution?,"So because I went to a quiet little town in there it was not as international as here and their opinions weren't as open-minded. There was a certain way of life, but it was really fun because I did make some very good friends.",,,,,
8,"Moldova is quite like an unknown country. In my opinion I really never met anyone from Moldova until I came here. It's like, do you get that a lot?","Yes definitely. Every time I say I'm from Moldova you can see the confused the glance on people's face like, ""oh I heard about it. I don't know if I can pinpoint it on the map"". That's what people say. And then I tell them that it's between Ukraine and Romania.",Yes.,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,,,
8,So the little I know about Moldova now is that like half or some of the population speaks Romanian and the other half speaks Russian. So do you speak both languages?,"I do I do. So most people actually speak both. But you're right. Half of it has primarily one language and half the other. Even we have some regions in Moldova that speak primarily Ukrainian or Bulgarian, because people migrated at some point.","I speak Romanian, Russian, French, Spanish and English.","So I speak Romanian, Russian, French, English, and Spanish.",I speak five languages. So my first language is Romanian and Russian. And then I learned French and English at school and recently I learned Spanish.,,
8,"So I think I was another conversation I had with Dan about that there's a country within Moldova, that he's from somewhere near the river.","So it's kind of like a region that's trying to be autonomous but it's not recognized. It's called Transnistria. It's divided from Moldova by a river, Dniestr or Nistru. And it's basically a very Russian speaking, concentrated place, and getting a lot of resources I think from Russia still. So they're enjoying that and they also I feel like they would feel ostracized in other parts of Moldova because it's still expected for you to speak Romanian even if broken Romanian, but since Russian and Romanian are so different it's quite difficult and out of your comfort zone to just try to speak it.",,,,,
8,OK so you've just graduated. That's exciting.,I'm so excited to graduate.,Yes.,Thank you!,,,
8,Let me think of a question.,"That's okay! Just just be louder, whatever you say.",Sure!,No Worries. Take your time.,,,
8,So I mean you had your entire four years so I guess I'll ask you first where you studied away and stuff.,Yeah. So I studied away in New York and Buenos Aires and I did a j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,Buenos Aires and New York.,Yeah I studied abroad in Buenos Aires and in New York and I had j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I've done a j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,
8,So did you do a home stay in Buenos Aires or did you stay in the dorms?,There were no dorms back in my days. In sophomore year I had to stay with a family. So it was an old lady who only spoke Spanish by the way. No English so that was great. As you notice I like to talk a lot and I had to learn Spanish to talk to her.,,,,,
8,"So do you think you're like comfortable speaking Spanish now, after it's been a while being there?","Well after it's been a while I'm not as fluent, but I definitely can hold a conversation or just go for it. Like of course it's way easier to recognize words than produce sentences, but I could. If I go there for a month I'll be back on track.","Definitely. Definetely. Afterwards I had the summer internship in New York and I was working at a music venue and we had our own cooks. And they were from Honduras and Guatemala. Their English was a bit broken and I was so excited to speak to them in Spanish and they were also so excited to see me try even though my Spanish was broken, but I was quite confident and having fun. So we became close and they were sneaking in avocados for me when nobody was looking.",,,,
8,"You guys are crazy with languages. I mean I try to pick up languages but it just doesn't happen for me. I feel like, yeah I guess the two Moldovans I know they speak like what, five languages each? Is that a thing you grew up doing or?",I guess because we from the get go speak like two or three languages cause Romanian and Russian is a given but they make us learn English or French as well at school. It's three from the get go. So you kind of get used to what it is like to learn another language.,So Moldova is a tiny country landlocked between Romania and Ukraine and it used to be part of Romania as well as part of the Soviet Union later. So now we speak two languages - Romanian and Russian.,,,,
8,So what languages do you speak?,"So I speak Romanian, Russian, French, English, and Spanish.","I speak Romanian, Russian, French, Spanish and English.",,,,
8,How good is your French?,"Well I went to francophone school so I studied all my education in French, but I have a strong accent and I'm losing my vocabulary.",Mmh my school... I went to a francophone school which means that everything was taught in French. That was an experiment that started the year I had to go to school. My parents decided to try it out. So we had to be tested to know if we really will be able to handle it. And so many of the students as well were going through the stage or they were questioning religion as well. And that kind of affected me too. But I was always a rebel.,,,,
8,So how come you picked Buenos Aires over going to Paris to practice French?,"Because I feel like I've had so much of French, most of my life, you know, and it's just Buenos Aires is also so far away and so foreign and I wanted to go to a place very far and also I knew that Spanish is even closer to Romanian than French. So I knew that I have a good chance to learn it. So I started learning it by myself a bit, before coming there. And then once I arrived there I picked it up in a semester.",Mmh my school... I went to a francophone school which means that everything was taught in French. That was an experiment that started the year I had to go to school. My parents decided to try it out. So we had to be tested to know if we really will be able to handle it. And so many of the students as well were going through the stage or they were questioning religion as well. And that kind of affected me too. But I was always a rebel.,,,,
8,What was your favorite part of Buenos Aires? I went to visit it in spring break so I really enjoyed the scene so I wanna know what you thought of it.,"I really love the nightlife. People are really fun. And they're very kind of open and very LGBTQ friendly as well. So open minded about that. But I didn't like the schedule like. They eat so late at night and they go to bars, like a party can just start at 2 a.m. I think that's too late, unnecessarily late.",I was studying abroad in Buenos Aires on my third semester and Spanish is quite close to the Romanian roots. It's a Latin language. So I picked it up while living with people who don't speak English at all. And I improved with Duolingo and my classes. So I learned it that semester.,"I loved Buenos Aires because I learned Spanish in the semester, but it was close to Romanian so again. But in New York, I loved the city so much that I really want to go back.",,,
8,"I didn't really, because they were so late, I didn't really get to do much of that. Well yeah the bars were empty at 10:00 o'clock which is insane.",Yeah 10 o'clock is not the time for bars.,Yes.,,,,
8,"I guess what, what do you like to do when you go out? Like are you a bar person are you club person?","I love clubs so I definitely love pre-drinking at home with my friends. Then go there drunk right away. I love clubbing because I love dancing and usually clubs have like a little bar place too. So I don't see why you would go just to a bar cause the music is so loud, it's so hard to speak.",,,,,
8,I guess like I love clubbing too. But like I guess I would go to the bar first to make friends. I'm a very social person. So like my perfect night out would be to go to the bar with a friend meet like two to three people and then going clubbing with them. Because what I've noticed I don't enjoy clubbing with my friends because like there's no point in going out if you're going to stand in your friends circle.,So you go alone usually.,,,,,
8,What would you do for fun here?,"I don't really go clubbing here. I would go to Dubai sometimes and club with my other graduate friends that graduated last year, so I have friends in Dubai now! But otherwise I can just go to a party on campus or you know just go hang out with my friends without drinking or with my boyfriend.","I like walking along the waterside next to Marina Mall. I think that's a very beautiful place to walk around at night. I like, eating wise, I love going to Chinese HotPot.",So I like rock climbing and I like biking. Basically all sports that don't involve going to the gym. And I like reading although I should be reading more. And I love singing. That's just so natural. I'm not saying I'm great. I just like it.,I love drawing sometimes but abstract basically that link. I loved volleyball and biking a lot and I am very interested in negotiation as a science and the aspects of communication.,"Sure! I love rock climbing and I love biking. I love reading, although I should do it more often. And basically I like all sports that don't involve going to the gym.","I don't really go clubbing here. I would go to Dubai sometimes and club with my other graduate friends that graduated last year, so I have friends in Dubai now! But otherwise I can just go to a party on campus or you know just go hang out with my friends without drinking or with my boyfriend."
8,So do you think campus is too small of a place to try and meet new people?,"No, definitely not. Of course we don't have that many people as the New York campus for example or any other campus. But the quality of people here is so high and I don't think it's that hard to meet new people. It depends on what you like as well and for some people it's suffocating to date someone here because you accidentally see that person all the time and you don't get your private space. But in terms of meeting new people, I think this university is really good because people are nice.",On campus I feel like relationships are very sped up and they become serious way quicker because you're around all the time and you accidentally almost spend way more time with a person than you should. And then people even move in with each other at the beginning. But to be honest I don't think it's a bad thing. I feel like it's just speeding up the learning process. You learn way faster. Who is not right for you.,,,,
8,"But in terms of like you're talking about like you know if you date someone and you break up with them they're there all the time. So I do like Marhaba stuff a lot and freshman orientation. Obviously there's like that formal orientation they get. But it's more like the informal orientation that really helps them, if someone is trying to make an informal guide, do you think stuff like this belongs in that informal guide? Like stuff like just be aware that, you know, if you're getting involved romantically or physically that it doesn't go the way you wanted to it is awkward afterwards.","Well I think maybe not stated like that, maybe people should say that it is a tight knit community so information spreads fast. I don't know if you should write that in there cause people find that out very quickly anyway. Even though it's an informal guide, making it into a guide is pretty freaking formal. So people would freak out and be like ""is it so bad that it had to be mentioned in writing?"". I would be freaking out if it was like that. Like it's bad, but it's not so bad, you know. I feel like people need to learn also to do their own mistakes, because it's like that everywhere you go. Dating can go wrong anywhere you go. Gossiping can go wrong anywhere. So it's a thing of being mature and learning that here it's slightly more.",,,,,
8,I respect that. You were an RA during... How long have you been an RA.,"So I've been an RA for this past year, senior year, and I'm a summer RA right now too, for two months.",Yes I'm a Resident Assistant. Even this year and in summer as well.,,,,
8,So your... what was your floor design?,My floor design... So I live in A5C 5th floor. It's lemurs.,,,,,
8,"OK. I saw that, yeah. How come? Why lemurs?","So we had like half a year to think about anything. And then I had so many things. I was thinking maybe BoJack Horseman or something cute like a museum installation. But then the day before the deadline, I was like ""lemurs"". No reason. Like I have nothing with lemurs, I have no past or no predilection towards lemurs, I just thought ""You know what, something random, lemurs!"" And then I just found thirty five lemurs on google. I hand picked them, the most hilarious and ugly ones. And that's how my floor theme came to life.",,,,,
8,"So how is your experience being like a senior RA? So I was thinking to myself like, you know, having senior girls living on your floor being an R.A. to them, like were these your friends before? How did that relationship change?","So I don't feel like my relationship changed to anyone. I feel it would be more complicated if I was younger than everyone else, right? Since I am at least their age or older it was quite easy to navigate that. And. I don't have to preach or be authoritative. I think my personality is like I'm telling you the rules. If something happens it's your fault. And I'm not going to be angry if you don't follow the rules. It's not my job to be angry or bring my emotions into it. But it's your job to take in the consequences if they happen. So with that attitude everyone's happy. Because you know I'm chill and I don't get in people's business and I felt a lot of respect from my residents and I respected them as well.","I love being an RA! In junior year I thought I really really wanted to be an RA and I was really really hung on this idea. When I applied I was thinking about it so much and then I got it and it was exactly what I expected it to be. It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of love that comes with it because when you're there for your residents and you're supportive that kind of bounces back and gets back to you. And I just love being part of the community and being able to improve it directly.",,,,
8,That's good. Did you always want to be an RA? And did you wait till senior year to do it?,"Freshman year you can't be RA, sophomore and junior year I was studying away. But in Junior year I had this urge that I need to be in a RA in senior year, I just needed to be. And I know the pay is good as well. And I knew it's the type of job that I would be really good at, cause I love people I love love love love people. And I wanted to feel like I'm making an impact and I actually wasn't that excited about the single room. I'd love to be in a single room in an apartment with my friends. That's so much more fun.",,,,,
8,"That's what I asked, I wanted to be an RA. But this is like the only reason was I wanted to live with my friends in senior year and like, you know, be part of like a room and do all that, so I went to ask and the answer was no because RAs need that space in case anyone else needs that space to have a private conversation. Do you think the role of RA here would be so completely different from London and New York?","In New York it's very very competitive. So because there are so many benefits in New York that could actually make a significant contribution to how much you pay for university, it's very competitive. People are cut-throat in those applications and I feel like they also take it way more seriously during the year. It's not like we RAs in NYUAD don't take it seriously. We just know when we're supposed to take it seriously. Like we know how to manage between being strict and being fun. But in New York a lot of resident assistants I feel like they just go crazy strict because they're afraid of losing their job because it's so important to them so they have a harder time navigating between the two.",,,,,

9,It's a yes or no question. I'd like to know whether you like pineapple on your pizza.,"Yes. You can ask me anything you can ask me about my family. You can ask me about my passions, you can ask me about my friends. Literally, don't complicate it.",Yes.,,,,
9,Where was the last place you went out?,I think I went with my parents to Emirates Palace to have tea with them. My parents just came through for my graduation.,,,,,
9,Did you go to the Louvre with your parents?,"My parents did have time to go to the Louvre, but I didn't join because I had some work.",,,,,
9,What are you busy with these days?,I am quite busy. I am working on the PPTP program with Nizar and Alberto and that's why I'm here right now.,So right now I'm doing a PPTP which is a program for people who have just graduated. I graduated three days ago. That's crazy. And so this is basically a transition into the real world because I'm doing research with a professor right now.,,,,
9,So do you think you'll go to the Louvre now that you're not busy?,I've been to the Louvre before. I've actually been with the university. Right when it opened.,,,,,
9,What's your favorite memory from university?,Ooh. My favorite memories from university is I I think just two things. All the places that I've been to and my parents being here for graduation was phenomenal.,"New York was definitely my most favorite place on earth and that's why I hope that in the future I'll be able to go back but I will have to sort out the visa issue and all that because I have... hum, I am a citizen of Moldova which is not the European Union so it will be tough to get a visa.","I loved Buenos Aires because I learned Spanish in the semester, but it was close to Romanian so again. But in New York, I loved the city so much that I really want to go back.","So as the graduation speaker said after this university being in such a diverse environment where people are so accepting and nice and intelligent, after you go out in the world there's not such a concentrated community of this type of people anymore. So I'm actually terrified of that. I don't know. I'll really miss being surrounded by spectacular, brilliant people all the time. And I'll miss my friends a lot. And I think I'll miss studying as well. I love studying. But I'm also tired of it. I want to go into the world, but I know I'll miss it.",,
9,Favorite place you've traveled to during your four years here?,New York City is definitely my favorite place. Do you want me to tell you why?,My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,"I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music, both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture. It's very it's quite futuristic even though some people might say it's dirty in some places but I love that it's always awake and people aren't overly polite nor actually overly rude because Eastern Europeans are quite cold in general. So I felt like it was a great balance. And there are many many people and so many diverse people and languages and so many cultures.",New York is lovely. It's my favorite place.,,
9,"Yes, I'd like to know why you like New York City..",I like New York City because it's just always alive. There's something happening at all times and there are people from all cultural backgrounds and it's very real. People don't fake what they feel. They tell you what they feel.,"I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there. It's the hub of music, both the music industry and the finance world. Exactly and just I love the architecture. It's very it's quite futuristic even though some people might say it's dirty in some places but I love that it's always awake and people aren't overly polite nor actually overly rude because Eastern Europeans are quite cold in general. So I felt like it was a great balance. And there are many many people and so many diverse people and languages and so many cultures.",,,,
9,Do you have any favorite spots around New York City?,I do love Washington Square Park and I love Central Park a lot. I love biking around Central Park.,,,,,
9,Which dorm did you live in New York City?,"I lived in Palladium. Although at first I wanted to go to Gramercy they gave me Palladium, but then I didn't regret it because it's so close to everything. It's lovely.",,,,,
9,Do you have any favorite street food spots around New York City?,The one in front of Palladium. Because there's the food carts. Right in front so you don't have to go far. But Palladium also has a great canteen. Again you don't have to go far to eat.,,,,,
9,What's your favorite thing to do when you're back home?,When I'm back home I love hanging out with my old friends. If they're there. And I love going to restaurants and spending my money that I earn here there. Because it's worth way more in Moldova right? The conversion rate. Then I feel rich and I eat good Moldovan food.,I love drawing sometimes but abstract basically that link. I loved volleyball and biking a lot and I am very interested in negotiation as a science and the aspects of communication.,"Yeah. There's cherries at the end of May. Like right now probably, but I'm not there.","I love clubs so I definitely love pre-drinking at home with my friends. Then go there drunk right away. I love clubbing because I love dancing and usually clubs have like a little bar place too. So I don't see why you would go just to a bar cause the music is so loud, it's so hard to speak.",,
9,Do you feel you've lost touch with your friends or family after coming to college?,Ooff. I feel... Some of them. But I feel like my real friends are still there for me even though we don't talk much and I would be there for them. And every time I come back we hang out even though we didn't speak for like a year.,"It didn't hit me yet because most of my friends are still here. I'm here working on PPTP, this is the program that we're part of right now. And I feel very thankful and grateful and happy, but I feel like in a few months I'll start dealing with this existential crisis that comes with graduating.",,,,
9,You feel like the bond that you made with your college friends is as strong as the ones you've had with your high school friends?,"A little bit, I feel, because here there is so much more diversity and I think it's so hard to keep in touch when you're studying abroad and doing all these crazy things and they are so busy that you kind of have to make an effort to stay friends, like close friends. So I do feel like some of the people now are very important to my life to a bigger extent.",,,,,
9,Going forward where do you see yourself this time around next year?,"I actually don't know. I am applying for jobs right now. I am hoping to be working at PwC in transfer pricing. Even though I'm a music major and economics minor. But we'll see what else comes around. Maybe consulting, maybe something in music.",I'm thinking of either doing a masters degree or applying for jobs for consulting. I'm applying right now and I'm also thinking of getting maybe a job composing music and being a sound engineer. But that's my third preference.,I hope to maybe work in consulting. Right now I'm applying for jobs. I'm still interviewing. So maybe working in transfer pricing. Tax would also be fun.,"I'm applying for jobs right now. I would love to do either consulting or transfer pricing, which is the area in tax. So I would love to stay here and work in Dubai preferably, otherwise if in two months it doesn't work out then it's probably for the best, there's probably something else and I'll go back to Moldova and look for jobs in Europe.",,
9,Why PwC?,Well because it is one of the biggest companies in the world of its kind and definitely a key player in the Middle East. And my professor actually works there as well so I hope to work on her team.,,,,,
9,Which Professor is this.,This is Alicja Reuben.,,,,,
9,Does she teach economics?,She teaches strategic management. You should definitely take her classes if you can.,,,,,
9,What's your favorite class you've taken in your four years here? If you had to name one single class.,Mmm. I think. My favorite class would be the one that I took at Stern in New York. Which is Negotiation and Consensus Building. It's a class about how to get what you want while still building relationships and giving the other side somewhat of a fair share. So leaving everyone satisfied while getting what you want. Unless you want me to tell you a favorite class in NYU Abu Dhabi?,My favorite course was a negotiation and consensus building in New York and fundamentals of acting in Abu Dhabi.,,,,
9,"We'll keep that on hold. For now, what's your opinion on like NYU Stern and the people at NYU Stern?","I feel like at NYU Stern people get sometimes this... they're a bit judged by others for being ""snakey"". But I personally met some really great NYU Stern people. I feel like maybe the freshmen the younger people who get in are, you know a little bit arrogant sometimes, but later on they become great people. The classes they take are also quite good. So it depends on the individual. Really, it depends.",,,,,
9,"So you would never hashtag ""I am Stern"" kind of person?","No I don't. I mean I don't think there's there's something wrong with identifying yourself with the college. I think it's OK. I'm actually wearing a Stern shirt underneath. It's funny, that's a coincidence. But. I think it's OK to be an NYU Stern cheerleader.",,,,,
9,That's great to hear. Where else did you study away? Just New York?,I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I've done a j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,Buenos Aires and New York.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,I studied abroad in New York and Buenos Aires and I did J-terms in Paris and Shanghai.,,
9,Shanghai? What are your favorite spots around Shanghai?,"I went to Shanghai when I was in my sophomore year and back then, I don't know... I didn't know that many people, those that I traveled with so I didn't go to so many places. But there was this one bar in which you could go and. Yes it's a long story. But there's this bar with a lot of foreigners in which they kind of pour alcohol from the air straight into your mouth. It's really crazy. But that was a good memory.",,,,,
9,Which pub was this?,I don't remember the name of the bar. But it was very nice. It was crazy. I went there once. It's what stands out in my memory most.,,,,,
9,But do you like Shanghai?,"I like Shanghai. I was very surprised to find out that the temperature was much warmer than in my country, Moldova, in Eastern Europe. But the pollution is really bad and I don't like that. And I find that the people in Shanghai are actually quite similar in mentality to people from my country. So and I don't really sympathize with the ideologies that are post-communist countries have.",Yes.,Sure!,,,
9,What mentality is that exactly?,"So more conservative. Moldova and China, what they have in common is being conservative because of the post-communist era. And less trusting, and smiling less, but also because I feel like they're are also hard-working people and they're hustling all the time so they don't have time for that. But, I feel like with time it'll change. They're great people overall just like Moldovans and they're great people. But the situation, political and social, is crazy.",,,,,
9,So are you optimistic that they're actually going to change the mentality over time?,"I don't think they necessarily have to change because to some people that's just the norm, like not smiling to everyone. You know there's two different kinds of cultures. There's collectivistic cultures and individualistic. So just because they're more collectivistic and aren't so individualistic like in the US where people smile all the time, work for just themselves / for the good of themselves. I don't find it a problem. Some people find it nicer like that. So not better, not worse, just different.",,,,,
9,You think you'd ever go back to China again.,"I would love to go back to China. Why not? I just don't know if I would live there. There's not many places in the world that I'm like ""oh, I wanna live there!"". So it depends on what career opportunities that I find or maybe if my significant other decided to go there. Maybe I would follow them. Maybe.",Yes.,Sure!,,,
9,"You think you'd like a city more or more quiet countryish sort of, since you've been to New York and Paris?","I feel like you during my younger years now until my 30s at least I want of city that's very alive and burning and hustling. But later on I'll prefer a countryside. By the way you're welcome to ask more personal questions if you want. Not only circumstantial, but also things that you would ask someone who you are already close with, you know? You can ask anything. Just remind so you know.",My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,New York is lovely. It's my favorite place.,,,
9,What would your ideal settling down place be? Where would you like to settle down?,"I would love for it to be New York. I would love to settle down in New York, but of course getting an American work visa is quite hard, not being a citizen there. So right now I'd love to work in Dubai even though I'm applying for jobs in Abu Dhabi as well. So in the next few years I would love to be in the the UAE and then we'll see.","I feel like New York is very vibrant. Everything is happening there.

I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,,
9,"So we spoke in about one year from now, but 10 years from now do you think you'd be with a family or do you think you'd be wanting the independent side, like I'm gonna be on my own and do my own thing. What do you think you will be doing?","What a great question. What a great personal question. So I still don't know. I literally have these two paths in my mind that are equally likely, as in both of those scenarios are equally likely. I think that there's a big chance that I'll have kids after my thirties, if I choose to do so, because you know with the overpopulation issue I feel like it's our responsibility to rethink how many kids we have, if any. But I do care about my career as well and I want to get really far and I definitely want to do that before I have any kids, if I choose to have any.","So, first of all I don't want to rush it. Whatever the reason is, I want to make sure I build a family with the exactly right person, because I'd rather be single than with the wrong person. And I see it all around me - parents of my friends divorcing and all families having problems. So I want I want to be more cautious. Another thing is the issue of overpopulation. I want to make sure I contribute with a new kid at the right time and that I have the right resources and. I'm already old enough to also teach my children how to live sustainably, and since I don't want to have many children, one or two maximum, I don't feel like there's a rush.",I could have a family in the future because I have very strong maternal instincts. I love babies and I love giving love and care to other people. So I'd be a great mom. At the same time I care about sustainability issues and the issues of overpopulation so I need to be sure that first of all I am intelligent enough to teach them how to be sustainable and all that but also make the decision of whether I want to adopt or. Just all these things you know. Like I don't know I see literally myself both having kids and not having kids in the future.,,,
9,You said that you have to think about the overpopulation issue and what not. But don't you think that's being unfair to yourself if you want to have a family?,"I don't think it's unfair because I'm not sad about it. You know. I feel like some people have this strong urge to have kids and have a family which is amazing and they should do it and it's awesome. I actually have strong maternal instincts, I'm very good with kids and I love kids and I'm like ""Oh my God let me hold that baby"". But at the same time there's nothing wrong in adopting. At the same time there's nothing wrong with hanging out with their nieces and nephews and helping other families out with their babies sometimes. Or for example having one kid or two max, you know, instead of having more. So it's not unfair because there's nothing that would make me less happy about that.",,,,,
9,"Do you already have names for your kids if you'd have them? One for a boy, one for a girl?","No. I've always imagined myself having a girl, for some, some weird reason. I'm sure I'd love a little boy too. But way before I thought of names like Alice or Sakura or Jasmine or things like that. But that's way in the past. And I was like a teenager speculating about my future, but now I don't have any name. I don't think I'll stick to anything.",,,,,
10,What is your name?,My name is Margarita.,I am Margarita.,My name is Margarita!,,,
10,How old are you?,I am 22 years old.,,,,,
10,So just introduce yourself to me.,So I am I'm 22 years old. I come from Moldova and I study music and economics at NYU Abu Dhabi. I just graduated.,"So my name is Margarita, I am from Moldova and I study music and economics.",So I was born and raised in Moldova. I've been for a year as an exchange student in the US during my high school. But that's about it.,,,
10,Why did you decide to double major?,So I'm actually not double majoring. I'm majoring in music and minoring in economics. I was going to double major. But I love both fields a lot and I couldn't decide between them. So I decided to study both.,I didn't double major. Do you want me to tell you why?,So economics is my minor. It would have been originally a double major. But I did not have time to complete everything so I had to choose. But I mainly did economics because first of all I wanted to have a plan B. And second of all I always loved mathematics so it seemed natural that my Plan B could be something lucrative and that involves my passion.,So economics is my minor.

10,And what do you like about music the best?,I like... Do you mean what area I am specializing in or... what fascinates me about music?,"So music was my passion for most of my life.

I'd never done economics before so I had no idea what it is.",I love all types of music. I feel like it depends on the piece. I love dubstep. I love electronic music. I also like ballads like the music that I write usually comes out very sad and romantic and like pop songs. So the music I write and the music I listen to are quite different.,,,
10,What fascinates you about music.,"So I feel that music is something surreal that can bring you into a whole different world, kind of like books.

10,So have you started feeling this right now or was it something that just came with you naturally?,I felt this love for music most of my life.

And a little bit of ukulele and cello.,"I play the piano and a little bit of ukulele and cello and I've been playing flute for a year. I do sing but mostly in music I am... I consider myself a composer and a sound engineer as well so making both songs, lyrics and music, and making music for film.",,,,
10,Oh nice. And you said that you're from Macedonia?,I'm from Moldova. Close enough!,So I'm originally from Moldova which is an Eastern European country. It's between Romania and Ukraine and I've lived most of my life there.,"I'm from Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe.",So I was born and raised in Moldova. I've been for a year as an exchange student in the US during my high school. But that's about it.,,
10,Tell me about Moldova.,So Moldova is a tiny country landlocked between Romania and Ukraine and it used to be part of Romania as well as part of the Soviet Union later. So now we speak two languages - Romanian and Russian.,"So Moldova used to be part of Romania and the Russia - Soviet Union. So the foods are combined from all over the place. We have some Romanian food. We have some Russian food. I feel like even some Turkish things were combined in there and so we eat a lot of soups and we eat a lot of grains like rice as well, but cooked and not bland white. And the western food is everywhere.","In Moldova we have all types of weather. We have four seasons and it gets from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40. So we have a huge range and we experience all seasons - Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. So I miss that.",Moldova borders Romania and Ukraine. And Moldova... We used to be part of Romania before it was also colonized by Russia and then we got united back to Romania and then was kind of the Soviet Union. So now we do speak both Romanian and Russian.,So Moldova has a great climate. We have four seasons. It's amazing because we speak two languages from the very get go. And we have really hot girls.,
10,So now it's an independent country?,Yes it's been independent since 1991.,Yes.,,,,
10,And why did it become independent?,Because in 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed and all the now 15 countries that were part of it gained its independence.,,,,,
10,"So is there any other Moldovan language that you speak, or...?",There is such a thing as a Moldovan dialect. Which is a mixture between Romanian and Russian.,,,,,

Basically all sports that don't involve going to the gym. And I like reading although I should be reading more. And I love singing. That's just so natural. I'm not saying I'm great. I just like it.,,,
10,And you said you liked rock climbing. Have you climbed any like mountains?,I really like rock climbing. I have climbed mountains but they didn't include that much rock climbing. You know what I mean? It was more of a walking like a hike. I've climbed the Fuji mountain in Japan. And climbed a mountain in Lebanon. But I mostly rock-climb indoors.,I really like rock climbing.

And climbed a mountain in Lebanon. But I mostly rock-climb indoors.,,,,
10,So you talked about Lebanon and in Japan. Do you travel a lot?,I do happen to travel a lot because of the university. At least I used to before graduating three days ago. But every time I travel it's almost with a purpose. It's not just seeing new places.,Yeah I studied abroad in Buenos Aires and in New York and I had j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,"I've been to New York, Buenos Aires, Paris and Shanghai.",,,
10,And where have you traveled yet?,"I've been to New York City, to Buenos Aires, to Paris and Shanghai.

10,And you just said you just graduated right?,Yes.,Yes.,,,,
10,How did it feel?,"It didn't hit me yet because most of my friends are still here. I'm here working on PPTP, this is the program that we're part of right now. And I feel very thankful and grateful and happy, but I feel like in a few months I'll start dealing with this existential crisis that comes with graduating.","I feel like I've grown so much at NYUAD. I've also grown accustomed to meeting good quality people all the time. And I feel so privileged to have all the resources both on campus and to travel abroad and learn there. So I feel like I've grown so much, but I also feel really grateful because it feels like it's not my merit. I feel like I'm very blessed.","So as the graduation speaker said after this university being in such a diverse environment where people are so accepting and nice and intelligent, after you go out in the world there's not such a concentrated community of this type of people anymore.

10,Have you decided what you want to do afterwards?,"I would love to work here. Maybe in consulting or transfer pricing which is tax. And I'm applying right now for jobs and I'm in the interview process because in the consulting world there's many many interviews one after another for the same role.

Right now I'm applying for jobs. I'm still interviewing. So maybe working in transfer pricing. Tax would also be fun.,,,
10,And why do you want to stay in the UAE?,"Because the Sheik's plan worked, of us falling in love with this place. And I never actually thought I would want to stay here. I thought I'm just coming to get my education and then leave, but actually after four years here I just became so accustomed to the culture. And especially like Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The other more conservative Emirates - I don't know if I would fit in so well. But everywhere else around here it feels like a nice life.","I would love for it to be New York. I would love to settle down in New York, but of course getting an American work visa is quite hard, not being a citizen there. So right now I'd love to work in Dubai even though I'm applying for jobs in Abu Dhabi as well. So in the next few years I would love to be in the the UAE and then we'll see.",,,,
10,And how do you like Abu Dhabi as a city?,"So I feel like Abu Dhabi is more family oriented which is not exactly for me because I don't plan to have a family, to build my own family too soon. After the next 10 years I think. But it's still a good place to be and it's more calm. As in peace of mind.",,,,,
10,You said you don't want to have a family in the next 10 years. Is it because of your career or is there any other reason?,"So, first of all I don't want to rush it. Whatever the reason is, I want to make sure I build a family with the exactly right person, because I'd rather be single than with the wrong person. And I see it all around me - parents of my friends divorcing and all families having problems. So I want I want to be more cautious. Another thing is the issue of overpopulation. I want to make sure I contribute with a new kid at the right time and that I have the right resources and I'm already old enough to also teach my children how to live sustainably, and since I don't want to have many children, one or two maximum, I don't feel like there's a rush.",I could have a family in the future because I have very strong maternal instincts.

At the same time I care about sustainability issues and the issues of overpopulation so I need to be sure that first of all I am intelligent enough to teach them how to be sustainable and all that but also make the decision of whether I want to adopt or. Just all these things you know. Like I don't know I see literally myself both having kids and not having kids in the future.,,,,
10,By what I get I feel like sustainability is a big part of your life. And why is that?,I really love the environment and I really try to live sustainably. Doesn't always work because of the products that are available. Sometimes you can't help it if you need a product that's wrapped in plastic. And you have no choice. But I really love the environment. I just got a tattoo of a tree on my my back as well. A pine tree. I just feel like the Earth is so beautiful that we have to take care of it. And that's another reason why I'm not rushing with having a family. Because I feel like climate change would impact so much the lives of our children that I want to be mindful whether I want to bring another child into this world. If the world's not seeming like it's going to a good direction.,,,,,
10,And you said you have a tattoo of a pine tree. Do you have any other tattoos?,No I only got that tattoo two months ago. Which is crazy because my family is against tattoos and it's my first one and I hope it's my last one.,,,,,
10,And does your family know and how did they react to it?,"So I first told my mom. My mom is who wears the pants in the family. So if I could just make her not be too angry about it everyone else would be fine. So I told her at first then she was OK. She was just begging me not to get another one. And I just found out that she actually has been wanting a tattoo for the past 10 years too, but she said she didn't get it because she didn't want me to get one after her. So that's quite ironic.",,,,,
10,Do you have any siblings?,I have a brother.,I have a brother.,I have one older brother.,,,
10,"Younger, older?",He's 5 years older.,He's 5 years older.,I have a sibling. He is five years older. He is a computer scientist and he lives in Moldova.,,,
10,"Oh, older. And, where is he?",He's back in Moldova.,He's back in Moldova.,Yes he's five years older. He is a software engineer. He is also trying to build his company although in Moldova that's really hard. So he might have to readapt and maybe go back into the job market. But yes right now he's left his job to try to start a company.,,,
10,Do you not interact with him much?,I do. I do. He's also working on his own stuff. And he has a long term girlfriend you know. So we're both busy. But when we have time we definitely Skype.,,,,,
10,And then you just graduated. If you were to summarize your time in NYUAD how would that be?,"I feel like I've grown so much at NYUAD. I've also grown accustomed to meeting good quality people all the time. And I feel so privileged to have all the resources both on campus and to travel abroad and learn there. So I feel like I've grown so much, but I also feel really grateful because it feels like it's not my merit. I feel like I'm very blessed.",,,,,
10,And if you were to give an advice to your freshman self. What would that be?,"To my freshman self I would just say that you'd be surprised how great you are. Because in my freshman year I had the imposter syndrome, like you know, ""I definitely don't belong here, everyone else is so amazing"". But I realized people are amazing in different ways and there are some things that I can do that other people can't. And it took me a while to realize that the things that I can do aren't average either. And so I would just tell my freshman self to relax. And just keep working and having fun. I'll be fine.",,,,,
10,"And do you interact with people from other nationalities or is it just from your country, your culture?",Yeah I mean all the time. Most of my friends are desi.,,,,,
10,Oh okay.,"India and Pakistan, most of them. I interact with some people from Europe, not specifically from Moldova because there's so few of us and we're in different years and different majors, so I don't really gravitate towards any particular nationality, just whoever is super nice. And I feel like because I've had a few really close friends in the desi community I've kind of become adopted by it because their circle is so tight. That I kind of automatically by the domino effect started becoming friends with more and more people.",,,,,
10,"And since coming here, have you broken any stereotypes? Things that you thought of people earlier and now that mentality has changed?","I guess we all come with some preconceptions. Mine I feel are more subconscious because I consciously try to be accepting and tolerant and be like ""Not better, not worse, just different"" you know. But on a subconscious level I think there might be still some, you know, preconceptions of when I see someone, by their looks I might assume their status or something and I try not to think like that. A thing that I improved on during the years, when it comes to my mentality, is about feminism and not judging other women. Because I was like... I was quite judgmental and I didn't know. I didn't know I'm judgmental. I thought, for example, like if somebody didn't shave their legs I would notice and be like ""wow"", you know, ""they don't care"", but it only took me later to realize this internalized misogyny that I'm forcing on myself and others.",,,,,
10,And has your hair always been this color or did you dye it?,So I started to dye my hair red when I was 14.,"I love it when people ask that question because it means it doesn't look too fake. No, my hair color is brown and I've been dying like this since I was 14.",,,,
10,Oh and why? Was it just like something you like?,"Yeah yeah, kind of, I guess I like attention.","I don't know, I guess I like attention. I mean many people in my family are either blonde or ginger or something and then I got brown so I felt like it's unfair. So I went for something different. Yeah. My dad has black hair and my mom is super blonde, her hair was like almost white in her childhood.",,,,
10,It makes you stand out.,"Thank you. Yes I guess. I don't have another crazy standing out feature, I thought ""might as well dye my hair red"". But actually lately I've been thinking whether I should die it back to brown because although I like attention I start to notice that I like attention when I want it. And now it's like very easy to recognize me in the crowd and I want to go more incognito in the future.",Thank you.,Thank you!,,,
10,And I see your hoodie. Were you an RA?,Yes I'm a Resident Assistant. Even this year and in summer as well.,"So I've been an RA for this past year, senior year, and I'm a summer RA right now too, for two months.",,,,
10,And which building?,"I've been an RA in A5, but this in an A6 hoodie because I stole it from Fahad.",,,,,
10,And how was your experience being an RA?,"I love being an RA! In junior year I thought I really really wanted to be an RA and I was really really hung on this idea. When I applied I was thinking about it so much and then I got it and it was exactly what I expected it to be. It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of love that comes with it because when you're there for your residents and you're supportive that kind of bounces back and gets back to you. And I just love being part of the community and being able to improve it directly.",,,,,
10,"And how's working with this as a department? Because we hear a lot of issues from students on campus about their bosses and how they're not responding to different issues? How has that experience been, working with that department?","Of course every department has its flaws, including ResEd. I feel like some of its flaws are exaggerated. Because students don't know what goes into a decision, that it's not just the ResEd's decision and sometimes they're tied by finance, or Serco. Definitely the people in the ResEd are very open minded. They're ready to listen to ideas but there are some things that are hard to change because you would have to change the whole system and that's hard to do.",,,,,
10,And this conventional NYUAD question: where have you studied away?,Yeah I studied abroad in Buenos Aires and in New York and I had j-term in Paris and Shanghai.,For my study aways I've been to Buenos Aires and New York.,Buenos Aires and New York.,,,
10,"Wow.. In terms of study away, did you spend a lot of time abroad? Which two experiences did you like better?","I loved Buenos Aires because I learned Spanish in the semester, but it was close to Romanian so again. But in New York, I loved the city so much that I really want to go back.",My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,My favorite place ever is New York. I just see myself there in the future but I never actually think of myself as finding one place and living there all my life. I feel like I would never be able to live more than 10 years in the same place though.,,,
10,"And then, after you learned Spanish did you try interacting with Spanish people?","Definitely. Definetely. Afterwards I had the summer internship in New York and I was working at a music venue and we had our own cooks. And they were from Honduras and Guatemala. Their English was a bit broken and I was so excited to speak to them in Spanish and they were also so excited to see me try even though my Spanish was broken, but I was quite confident and having fun. So we became close and they were sneaking in avocados for me when nobody was looking.",,,,,
10,Yes. Yes exactly. Exactly.,Exactly.,,,,,

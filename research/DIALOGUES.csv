So like the whole city is like a capital of meth. So what do you feel about that? Does that change what you previously said?,That... I never heard about that before. So it doesn't really change what I think about it. It depends again on what the research out there says if it's comprehensive on the effects of such drugs. If such drugs are still not researched I think they they shouldn't be legal because it could be very dangerous.,,No.,,,,,

PER,4,12,TRAIN,How do you feel like your perspective or like your values or like you as a person has changed since you first came here?,"So it's a great question. I feel like I've definitely become more tolerant and accepting. I always used to think that I'm also tolerant and I'm so much better than other people, I'm so open minded.

And right now I've noticed that actually you know as a woman it's harder to achieve a few things. Some things of course at university level or at an entry level jobs you don't see it that much, but when you look at who are the CEOs of the biggest companies you know it's always men because you know there were men before they still recruit men and it's a cycle that it's really hard to break.

How about like your perception of like religion, like are you religious or?","So I'm agnostic I think. I was brought up Christian Orthodox like most people in my country. And I find religions beautiful because I see that power for them to unite people. But I sometimes know it's also dangerous because of people misusing it.

Before I had the concept that the religions are crazy different. Now I understand that they're all so similar and even the holy days happen very close to each other.

PER,4,16,TRAIN,And I think at the end it all preaches the same. I just wanna know like what did you think of like when you first heard about Ramadan?,"Ahh I was just surprised, I didn't know much about it before and I was like okay, cool, a new thing.

PER,4,17,TRAIN,"So that's like one of the things I just don't agree with. I think the whole concept of Ramadan is like feeling what the less privileged feel, and so they're not guarded. They don't have boundaries like they see other people eating other people enjoying and they just don't have expenses to like fulfill what they want either. So it really does defeat the purpose which is why I don't understand.","Yeah. And of course I believe that you should be respectful and you know we should be taught that you know always if someone's fasting be nice, don't eat in front of them.

PER,4,18,TRAIN,Yeah because I think it makes people uncomfortable as well. Like if someone is restricting themself from eating in front of me and like I feel bad because I. Like I'm doing this for my own purpose. Like I don't like when a whole community like especially on this campus like when the whole like NYUAD community is now restricted from eating freely in the marketplace having drinks in class like you know people have conditions they have to.

PER,4,19,TRAIN,Yes I think... How is your romantic life. Or like your perception of it changed from being off campus to on campus. Because I think on campus like all kinds of relationships are really like on steroids. Like the smallest like a very small conflict here just blows up and off campus like it wouldn't be that much of a deal. Like have you experienced things like these?,On campus I feel like relationships are very sped up and they become serious way quicker because you're around all the time and you accidentally almost spend way more time with a person than you should. And then people even move in with each other at the beginning. But to be honest I don't think it's a bad thing. I feel like it's just speeding up the learning process. You learn way faster.

PER,4,20,TRAIN,But then I feel like all those small phases in the beginning like you don't really get to experience those.,"Maybe not, but then you will be able to experience that in the future and appreciate it.

PER,4,21,TRAIN,So do you think the a campus being isolated on a separate island is like a good idea?,"I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea.

In this context it makes sense because where else would they have built such a huge campus?,,,,,
PER,4,22,TRAIN,Didn't it use to be in the city?,"It did, it did. Right? So but then they build the campus because the university needed to expand and they needed more facilities.

PER,4,25,TRAIN,No I think it's like this campus is already very open on its own and like we already have like an endless amount of strangers coming onto campus like they's always like incidents accidents things that happen that could be prevented. And I think it's like really it's very odd I think because like being here for two years and it's like isolated and then and you can see in the near future that there are gonna be like a ton of people but always coming in and off campus.,"But I feel like it's the same thing with other universities, you know. There is some restriction of who can enter, but otherwise if it's a guest it's fine. I guess having it more closed would be weird. Because right now as well nobody can enter residences unless you're signed in. They locked out those doors on the side so nobody can sneak.

The people are lovely but the socio-economic situation is so bad. It's not an environment you can blossom in. And my parents since I was very young they instilled this idea ""you're going to leave, you're going to go to a better place and then in the end you're going to take us with you"". So it was never even in my mind to stay, ever. But now I'm having these ideas that maybe in the future I should come back and actually make a change because now I'm becoming less selfish and thinking only about my family.

And the only thing that differentiates us really from the other people in other countries is where you're born and that's it. So every country is trying to take care of their citizens but some are failing and I feel like it's almost a little bit of propaganda. The governments are trying instill so that people don't leave their country if they don't like it. That you know that you should stay and give back. I mean if if a country is doing nice things for you... What is a country? It's like if the community is doing nice things for you and loves you at least, is trying to push you up, then of course you feel a sense of duty that you should give back, but nobody owes anyone anything just because they were born in a certain spot.

But because I'm a girl I wasn't allowed to go out with as late and all that. But I was still lucky that my brother got to go abroad first so that I was allowed to go alone abroad as well. You know, especially to an Arab country, which my brother wasn't allowed to do. And then I grew up five years later and then I talked to his friends who graduated by then. And that's when I realized that all the preconceptions about the Middle East aren't entirely true. Especially about the UAE.",,I loved it!.,,,,,
PER,7,13,TEST,How's it like to grow up as a woman in Moldova?,"Well at first sight it's normal and... people in Moldova would be very confused by this question. But now that I went abroad and I know what feminism is and all that I can see that there's not equal opportunities, although women now are expected to work as well because people are like ""oh equality, right? women should work"". There's not actually the same attitude about house chores and who takes care of the kids. So it's crazy although over time the responsibilities of men went down, the amount of them, like they don't have to hunt for food anymore right. They don't have to. They just go to the office now and it's good. But now women have doubled their responsibilities, cause they still have to make the food, they still have to clean the house. You still have to raise the kids. But also they now do what men do, and go to the office. So it's crazy. Yeah. So I feel like it's very similar in many, many places around the world.

PER,7,14,TEST,What's your least favorite part about NYUAD?,"My least favorite part about NYUAD is the fact that when we study abroad it's harder to maintain relationships. And you find that people keep studying abroad at different times. So you could not see your friend maybe for a whole year and a half because you keep studying in different places at different times. So it's very hard to maintain good relationship, but at the same time because there are not that many people at this university and it's such a tight knit community, that's kind of equalized by that, you know, like, there's a balance cause then you come back and then you see them all the time.",,I think the Abu Dhabi and the Shanghai campuses are more intense in terms of studying compared to the New York campus.,"Our campus is located on an island and it's very different from any other university.

I'd love to be part of the community that's so caring and open minded and considerate about minorities as well. That sounds cool, but I'm not going to actively work towards it.

I feel my biggest dream is to make enough money so that I can give my parents anything they want so that they can travel more and bring them wherever I go. And then afterwards I do want to do something that's impactful on the world. Maybe do some philanthropy, open my own company, because otherwise I don't see meaning in life. I'm not saying everyone should do that. For some people the meaning of life is to find happiness. For me happiness will come from meaning, you know finding a purpose in life bla bla.

It's called Transnistria. It's divided from Moldova by a river, Dniestr or Nistru. And it's basically a very Russian speaking, concentrated place, and getting a lot of resources I think from Russia still. So they're enjoying that and they also I feel like they would feel ostracized in other parts of Moldova because it's still expected for you to speak Romanian even if broken Romanian, but since Russian and Romanian are so different it's quite difficult and out of your comfort zone to just try to speak it.",,(Silent nod),,,,,

Of course we don't have that many people as the New York campus for example or any other campus. But the quality of people here is so high and I don't think it's that hard to meet new people.

Like stuff like just be aware that, you know, if you're getting involved romantically or physically that it doesn't go the way you wanted to it is awkward afterwards.","Well I think maybe not stated like that, maybe people should say that it is a tight knit community so information spreads fast. I don't know if you should write that in there cause people find that out very quickly anyway. Even though it's an informal guide, making it into a guide is pretty freaking formal. So people would freak out and be like ""is it so bad that it had to be mentioned in writing?"". I would be freaking out if it was like that. Like it's bad, but it's not so bad, you know.

If something happens it's your fault. And I'm not going to be angry if you don't follow the rules. It's not my job to be angry or bring my emotions into it.

Do you think the role of RA here would be so completely different from London and New York?","In New York it's very very competitive. So because there are so many benefits in New York that could actually make a significant contribution to how much you pay for university, it's very competitive. People are cut-throat in those applications and I feel like they also take it way more seriously during the year. It's not like we RAs in NYUAD don't take it seriously. We just know when we're supposed to take it seriously. Like we know how to manage between being strict and being fun.

PER,9,16,TEST,You feel like the bond that you made with your college friends is as strong as the ones you've had with your high school friends?,"A little bit, I feel, because here there is so much more diversity and I think it's so hard to keep in touch when you're studying abroad and doing all these crazy things and they are so busy that you kind of have to make an effort to stay friends, like close friends.

But I personally met some really great NYU Stern people. I feel like maybe the freshmen the younger people who get in are, you know a little bit arrogant sometimes, but later on they become great people. The classes they take are also quite good.

PER,9,23,TEST,"So you would never hashtag ""I am Stern"" kind of person?","No I don't. I mean I don't think there's there's something wrong with identifying yourself with the college.

So and I don't really sympathize with the ideologies that are post-communist countries have.",,I loved it!.,,,,,
PER,9,28,TEST,What mentality is that exactly?,"So more conservative. Moldova and China, what they have in common is being conservative because of the post-communist era. And less trusting, and smiling less, but also because I feel like they're are also hard-working people and they're hustling all the time so they don't have time for that.

PER,9,29,TEST,So are you optimistic that they're actually going to change the mentality over time?,"I don't think they necessarily have to change because to some people that's just the norm, like not smiling to everyone. You know there's two different kinds of cultures. There's collectivistic cultures and individualistic. So just because they're more collectivistic and aren't so individualistic like in the US where people smile all the time, work for just themselves / for the good of themselves.

I literally have these two paths in my mind that are equally likely, as in both of those scenarios are equally likely.

I feel like some people have this strong urge to have kids and have a family which is amazing and they should do it and it's awesome. I actually have strong maternal instincts, I'm very good with kids and I love kids and I'm like ""Oh my God let me hold that baby"". But at the same time there's nothing wrong in adopting. At the same time there's nothing wrong with hanging out with their nieces and nephews and helping other families out with their babies sometimes.

PER,10,16,TEST,So you talked about Lebanon and in Japan. Do you travel a lot?,I do happen to travel a lot because of the university. At least I used to before graduating three days ago.

And I see it all around me - parents of my friends divorcing and all families having problems. So I want I want to be more cautious. Another thing is the issue of overpopulation. I want to make sure I contribute with a new kid at the right time and that I have the right resources and I'm already old enough to also teach my children how to live sustainably, and since I don't want to have many children, one or two maximum, I don't feel like there's a rush.",,"In 10 years I hope to have my own business.

I just got a tattoo of a tree on my my back as well. A pine tree. I just feel like the Earth is so beautiful that we have to take care of it. And that's another reason why I'm not rushing with having a family.

But on a subconscious level I think there might be still some, you know, preconceptions of when I see someone, by their looks I might assume their status or something and I try not to think like that. A thing that I improved on during the years, when it comes to my mentality, is about feminism and not judging other women. Because I was like... I was quite judgmental and I didn't know. I didn't know I'm judgmental. I thought, for example, like if somebody didn't shave their legs I would notice and be like ""wow"", you know, ""they don't care"", but it only took me later to realize this internalized misogyny that I'm forcing on myself and others.",,I feel like I've definitely become more tolerant and accepting.,It makes you more tolerant and you understand the world better.,,,,

So from the financial point of view.,So you apply to NYUAD through this website that's called Common Application which you can use for other universities at the same time. And there are scholarships that come from this university. Most students that are here are actually on that scholarship because that is the big incentive from students from all over the world to come to the Middle East to study when they've never been here.,,You apply to NYUAD through this website that's called Common Application which you can use to apply to multiple universities at the same time.,"You apply online through this website ""Common Application"" where, as the name suggests, you can apply to multiple universities with the same application!",,,,
EDU,1,3,TRAIN,How much is this scholarship and what does it cover?,"To be honest, for different students it's different. There are some students that only get half of it, if they're quite well off, but most of the other students are quite poor or like can't afford it from their financial statements so they get everything covered. Tuition, and books, and travel, and food, and accommodation, and even some extra stipend.",,"Many students here are on full scholarship, but all of them have at least partial scholarships.",,,,,

EDU,1,5,TRAIN,Do you have to be here during the summer? Are you...

EDU,1,6,TRAIN,And in which language do you attend the classes and is it obligatory to attend in other foreign languages.,"The classes we attend them in English. All classes are in English because it's an American university, and though you could take some other classes, but they're not really that official. Some other language classes.

EDU,1,8,TRAIN,Yes. Exactly. Or there is a system it is in this way that in first year you do some courses and after you decide what you actually want to do?,"You have to declare your major at the end of the second year. So you can take whatever classes you want, but you have to keep in mind that some majors... all majors have requirements, classes that you must take, and for some majors there's more requirements. So if you start very late, you are not going to be able to do some majors, right? For example like engineering. You have to start earlier, there's more classes for engineering than for music, that are mandatory. And some of the classes they also follow each other. There's prerequisite. So basically you have the freedom, but you kind of should look at your options carefully and make a plan and try them out.",,"You choose your classes, but you need to take some specific ones for your major and some from specific categories.",You have to declare your major at the end of the second year.,Graduating requirements differ from major to major so it depends on your situation.,,,

EDU,1,10,TRAIN,"And perhaps you can make your own orientation, for example, there are some certain orientation for arts, only mostly art classes.",What do you mean orientation?,,You can do multiple majors.,NYUAD offers Bachelor of Science and Arts.,,,,
EDU,1,11,TRAIN,"I mean, for example, you have an idea that you want to do something in between technology and music.",The direction.,,Of course you can!,,,,,
EDU,1,12,TRAIN,"Yes. Direction. Yes. So you have possibility and the freedom to create perhaps like a tuned major from two different schools to combine, so to have a different specialty on something.","Yes, you can combine majors. It's considered still one school, because in NYU New York you do have different schools. You know, school of arts, school of science, you know, you have that... Here in NYU Abu Dhabi it's one school with 1300 students but different majors. So you can definitely combine majors, because they're in the same classrooms, but the different classes. So that's why I have a music major and economics minor.",,Yes.,You can do multiple majors.,,,,
EDU,1,13,TRAIN,Can you... When do you start your studies and is there any way that you learn what possibility you have to find a job if you follow this direction that you like mostly?,"There are events in which you can speak to alumni, like people who attended university and they can tell you more. But there is Career Development Center which is a department that helps you out with your career, planning your career. But nobody can tell you for sure ever. And a lot of the finding the job is on you, and my mom was also very surprised because back in her days when she would do a whole degree, the state with place her as a doctor somewhere. That was our communist Moldovan.

EDU,1,14,TRAIN,What is the percentage of people that go into work straight away from the degree?,"There are some statistics, but it's not very clear if they're skewed because you have an impression that the people who are gonna take those surveys are the ones who got the job. Because if you didn't get the job, you're like, ""Oh I'm not going to take this survey yet because I'm still looking"". So it says that, I don't know, like 90 percent or 95 percent have a job and 3 percent took a gap year or something very exaggerated like that, but they don't...

EDU,1,15,TRAIN,Do most people stay in Abu Dhabi or the UAE or they just go around the world?,"Both, both. I feel like it's half and half. There are a lot of people saying, which is quite surprising. Nobody is forcing us. Nobody is even insinuating that, ""Hey we're giving you the scholarship from the country, so you must stay here"", which is amazing. And because nobody is forcing anybody, you kind of start loving this place and you want to kind of stay. You're like, ""Hey, this is good, I like this!"".",,"More people go to another country after graduation, but a considerable number stay in the UAE.",,,,,
EDU,1,16,TRAIN,"Yes of course because they give you the money, so you start to look at the place because they do something good for you and so you appreciate it. What are the negative aspects of NYUAD?","So relationships on campus... when you're dating someone, they're very sped up because you're so close to that person all the time anywhere on campus and you see each other all the time. So a relationship of one year could feel like three years because you're just there all the time. You don't have to make any effort or any scheduling to meet each other you're just there accidentally you even meet when you're dating. Another negative aspect is like... in study-aways your friends probably are studying away at different times for a whole semester so you might not see your friends for a year and a half because you're like, one semester you're studying, another semester they are studying away. So it's hard, and like the relationships are harder. And another thing is that on this campus sometimes there's not that much... It's a bit isolated from the city. It was more so before the public bus was introduced.",,"Relationships are harder to maintain because of all the study-aways. Also, the campus is a bit isolated from the city so it's not as lively.",,,,,
EDU,1,17,TRAIN,Oh it was not straight away the public bus?,"No no no, maybe last year. But now it's better.",,No.,,,,,
EDU,1,18,TRAIN,"Is there for people who perhaps feel depression or isolated, for the students is there a way to make them feel better or is something organized to help them, because it happens to young people who live far from their homes, their families...","Of course of course. For freshmen who are just starting the university there is this show called RealAD, like reality show, Real AD. And it's about all the struggles that students go through, created by upperclassmen for freshmen so that they see that, you know, many students actually don't understand what's going on in their classrooms. Many students misunderstand other cultures. Many students feel like everyone is smarter than them, you know, or many students miss home. So they understand that it's fine, and also there's counseling services. There's also many events in which you celebrate culture or different holidays and it's quite good, actually. I feel like they're quite successful. And then in this university the stigma about mental health is smaller than in other places. So although it's not perfect, it's still better than in other places. It's easier for them to go and seek help or go to a counselor and there's not such a big stigma.",,There's counseling services and many events to connect and talk about your experiences.,,,,,
EDU,1,19,TRAIN,I have a question. How do you feel about being a woman in the UAE as a student?,"In public places, like when I'm being served somewhere, food or something, I feel very respected when I go to a clinic or something. I'm very respected. I feel it's also because I'm white. Definitely, you know, they smile extra for me. But also at the same time there's this hardship every time a walk on the street, people really stare. Especially a South-Asian men. And it's just so hard. The other day I had someone pull up with a car and follow me slowly and tried to talk to me. And it doesn't matter what I wear, sometimes I also wear shorts, like back at home. But sometimes I decide, ""You know what, today I don't want attention at all."" I'm gonna wear long jeans and a long shirt - doesn't help. So it's this.. you know.. at home people stare as well, of course, everywhere, but they're a bit more subtle. You know if you look at them they look away. Here they just stare at you and you look at them and they continue.",,"I feel safe, but women here do get a lot of unwanted stares.",,,,,
EDU,1,20,TRAIN,Do you feel safe?,"I feel very safe. I feel like my privacy is invaded and it just feels irritating and unfair all the time. But I feel way more safe. I mean, with the female seats on the bus where nobody can sit next to me and people leave me alone, that's wonderful, because even at home people would sit next to me on the bus and start talking to me and not get the point that I'm sitting alone for a reason. And at night I also feel very safe here. This is one of the safest countries in the world, it is very interesting, in a place where people invade your privacy so much it's also very safe in terms of crimes.",,"I feel safe, but women here do get a lot of unwanted stares.",,,,,
EDU,1,21,TRAIN,"It's because they apply the law, that's why. That's the reason.... if they don't apply the law, how to be safe? Anyway... how... Every country has a different education system. So some countries they are more focused on academics, some other countries they are less focused on academics. This difference in the level... of the education level, how it is faced? Because you have what you attend the courses, the level I think that it must be similar and the material is similar. So how... What does the university do to adjust these differences between the knowledge of all the students? It's because they have to be in the same level to be able to attend the classes.","Well first of all they start with selecting the brightest students they can find from around the world and they're trying not to be too biased and select only from international programs, but they are a little bit biased because, you know, when someone has done some international schooling or some exchange program before, then they're more adapted and this is an indicator that they'll be successful here. But even with that it's still different, right? In the education, what you've studied... And so what they do is in the first year they give you some tests like, for example, writing, English writing, and they classify you in levels and then according to your level you have to take like one or two classes that are for writing. Same thing if you want to do like mathematics, unless you want to do arts and you don't need, it but if you do something that needs mathematics like sciences, then they also place you in a level and there's... I think you need to get until multivariable calculus for most majors. So you could be placed, in function and then you have like three different classes to take, or you can be placed in the next one - vectors, or in the next one calculus. Depending on where you're placed, this is how much more you have to take classes.",,There's counseling services and many events to connect and talk about your experiences.,,,,,
EDU,1,22,TRAIN,"So this means that like for example let's say in the UK or Italy, not sure about Greece, if you want to do let's say I want to do physics, and in Italy you have to do a test before being admitted. But let's say that I want to do Physics, and I perform really poorly in the math test. What happens next?","Then you will have to take all those math classes, but that doesn't mean that you can't take the other classes. You can still take them, it's just sometimes you have prerequisites of a math class for some classes, sometimes you don't. So it just might take you more time, but it's definitely doable. This university has created a system that if you really feel like science is user thing but you messed up math a lot you can still you know take all the other classes and then do it.",,"The exams are decided by the professor of the class: how hard they are, how important they are and whether you have exams at all!",,,,,
EDU,2,1,TRAIN,What happens if you fail a test like an exam? What happens then? Like do you have a requirement to do X numbers of exams per year?,"No we don't have anything like that at all. The exams are decided by the professor in the class, whatever they want to do. So it's not like you have to give again the exam later on, you would have to take that class all over again. If you fail it, if it's a requirement for your major. If it's not a requirement for your major you do whatever you want, we don't care if you pass or fail, right. But if it's a requirement, you have to pass it.",,"The exams are decided by the professor of the class: how hard they are, how important they are and whether you have exams at all!",,,,,
EDU,2,2,TRAIN,"OK but so. So I guess my question is, can you like fail university. So for example. So in Italy there is not such a thing, right. You have usually twelve exams per year, if you don't have the 12 per year you're gonna do them the next year. But in the UK it's not like that. You have to take those exams that year and if you fail them you can retake maybe like one or two in September, but if you fail them again... I mean you're kicked out. So that's my question here. Like so is that everyone does the university in three years or four years?","No. Not everyone does the university in four years. But I also don't hear about people who fail. There's different names for it. Sometimes students take a gap year. Like when they feel like overwhelmed, you know, they take a break. They could study a bit or do something else, or it happens that students maybe didn't do enough credits and there's a number of credits you have to take. So the university also actually gives you an extra semester and still funds you. Which is crazy. Like it's your fault you didn't pass, but they still help you. You have to do two physical educations as well. If you haven't done one and you graduated, they force it to stay for summer for a physical education class.",,Not really.,,,,,
EDU,2,3,TRAIN,And they pay you.,Yeah! That's crazy too.,,"Yes, exactly.",Yes.,,,,
EDU,2,4,TRAIN,And how the universities chooses the students? And how did you learn about this university?,"Okay so how does the university choose the students. There are a lot of criteria. They say that they look at everything, as a whole, not one criterion is more important for them than the others. They look at your grades, and they look at your exam. Like international exam or your national examination or S.A.T. standardized test scores. And then they look at your extracurricular activities, your leadership activities, and then they look at your essays. There's about three essays, like ""tell us about your story when you were a leader"" or competition or something you've learned. Stuff like that. And then, ""Why do you wanna go to this university?"" and then ""What can you bring to this university?"". So they look at this whole thing as one thing.

People who believe in the bigger picture and try to make a change.","I always wanted to go abroad for my education.

And so this university also likes students that have done FLEX before, because they're kind of leaders.

EDU,2,9,TRAIN,"I don't know. I mean it is announced somewhere in all schools, for example, in your country? And so each child has the possibility should be there to approach the program?

And if you have good grades, then you go there?","Oh it's not just good grades, I told you there's so many criteria.

So even in Moldova I think there was this fair or something, university fair, in which this this university sent someone to the capital or something, but it didn't reach my little village. I'm from a little village, from a little school. Literally my only privilege is the fact that I've been through that exchange program. Somehow, I was so lucky to go through, so they saw me as competent. So this is what I'm saying that technically, see I'm from a small village, I don't have rich parents, I didn't go to international education, I didn't study my school in English. But the fact that I've been for one year abroad, they already saw me as competent.

But then because everyone speaks English in this country I never had to speak Arabic, but also because so many of my friends come from Pakistan and India I know more Urdu that I know Arabic.",,"I studied abroad in Buenos Aires and since Spanish is quite close to the Romanian roots, Latin, I learned it in that semester.",,,,,
EDU,3,8,TRAIN,Oh I see. I see. Yeah. Yeah. So how did you adapt to the Arabic culture?,"Actually it was quite easy especially because New York University in Abu Dhabi is almost like its own bubble. It's on an island and separated from the city and the rules are a bit more lenient, you know, it's not as conservative. And so it was almost like I didn't have that much to adapt to, maybe the heat. It's a very international community. And of course it's a Muslim country and I've already met... I've had, as you know, many Muslim friends in the US and I did an exchange year before. So I kind of knew a little bit about how it works and I've just been here during Ramadan as well this year and celebrated. So it was quite a smooth transition.",,It was quite a smooth transition because I'm open-minded and people here are friendly!,,,,,
EDU,3,9,TRAIN,I see. That's great. Sounds very good. Very cool. How many international students do you have? Like are there a lot of people coming abroad?,"Yes exactly we have probably only 15 percent of Emirati students, that are local from this country, and then every one else is from abroad, there's from the US, there's from anywhere in Europe - Eastern Europe, Western Europe, there's a lot from post-Soviet countries. A lot of flex students actually.",,"Probably only 15 percent are Emirati students, and everyone else is from around the world.",,,,,
EDU,3,10,TRAIN,That's nice.,"Mhm. This is how I got here. I knew a flex alumnus guy who went here, so... And then I came here too.",,Thanks!,Thanks.,,,,
EDU,3,11,TRAIN,I see. About your major. I've never asked what major are you.,Yes. I'm a music major and economics minor.,,"I studied music and economics. I'm a music major, economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.",,,,,
EDU,3,12,TRAIN,"Oh, great. So which one do you like better? Or which one is like the most appealing to you?","I like both a lot for different reasons. What they both have in common is math. They're very structured and they make sense to me. That's the reason why I studied both because I couldn't choose either one. Music completes this artistic side of me and that technological side of me because I studied composition and sound engineering, but with economics it fulfilled my more social and analytical side because I wanna learn about how to make an impact in the world and I love math.",,"Music completes this artistic and techie side of me because I studied composition and sound engineering, but economics fulfilled my social and analytical side, because I wanted to learn about how to make an impact in the world and I love math.",,,,,
EDU,3,13,TRAIN,"Great to hear. How about the classes? Like when you were freshman, did you have an opportunity to select whatever you want? Or you had this specific list of the classes that you had, have to choose?","Yes, we could choose whatever classes we want. It's very similar to the American system. You do have a set list of classes that you'd have to take for whatever major you choose, but you didn't have to declare your major until sophomore spring. You know, so halfway through university you have to choose your major. So the first and second year you have a chance to experiment like crazy, but you need to take into account that some majors have more prerequisites, classes that you absolutely have to take in those four years and some majors have less. So you have to kind of plan accordingly and you have a freedom of when to take lessons, but sometimes not really because there are classes that evolve in an order, you know, one's the prerequisite for another.",,"You choose your classes, but you need to take some specific ones for your major and some from specific categories.",,,,,
EDU,3,14,TRAIN,"Yes I got this. Sounds good. How about the professors? Could you communicate with them like, or like let's say you have an idea about some project. So was it easy to communicate with your professor and have it like in the class and present it?","Definitely definitely. Do you mean more about getting help for inside of the class or outside of the class, like doing research and projects?",,"Professors here are amazing. I got all of my internships, research opportunities and even a full-time job with their help.",,,,,
EDU,3,15,TRAIN,Yeah outside of the class.,"So this university is really good when it comes to student life and professors are all like us, very internationals, from very different walks of life and it's a very tight knit community because we have, I don't know, about a thousand three hundred students in total, so I kind of all professors know almost each student. And of course it depends on the professor, how friendly they are. But most of my internship and research opportunities and I even might be getting a job right now full time because of my professor, so all those things come from my professors. They're very kind here.",BrokenExchange,"Professors here are amazing. I got all of my internships, research opportunities and even a full-time job with their help.",,,,,
EDU,3,16,TRAIN,It's good to hear. Sounds very very good.,Thank you.,,For sure!,Thanks.,,,,
EDU,3,17,TRAIN,What year of your studies was the hardest?,"That's hard to put it. I think both freshman year and senior year. Freshman year because I... it was a little bit sad, you know, it was really hard to make friends and I didn't expect that since I felt ""oh I'm so extroverted, it's gonna be easy"", but then only later on when you grow more, grow up, you realize, ""oh everyone had that problem in this foreign country, with all these foreign people, you know? And senior year... And then second and third year was quite easy like a breeze. I knew the system. I had good friends and I didn't have to worry about finding a job or my final year thesis. It was a breeze. And then in senior year I had to work on my thesis and I was really worried about getting jobs, but at the same time because I've been overloading before, like taking more classes than necessary, in senior year I was able to take less classes than necessary. So I was kind of... I had some time for myself and I wasn't, you know, overwhelmed.",,"Freshman year was hard because everything was so new, and senior year was stressful because of job-hunting.",,,,,
EDU,3,18,TRAIN,I see. About your campus. What was your favorite place to study on campus?,"So our library is really beautiful, but I don't really like studying in a library. So there's this one tree that kind of people could pass by, but they don't look in that direction, never, because of how the road curves and... There's shade so I would take a bean bag and hide under that big tree. It was just... It just felt like a paradise. I would go there alone and birds were singing. So that was my favorite place read or study. Or then in my friends' rooms. Yeah. My friends' rooms always help.",,There is this one tree on campus with lots of shade and birds chirping that other people don't notice for some reason. That's my favorite place!,,,,,
EDU,3,19,TRAIN,I see. That's good. How about the dormitory? Did you live on campus like...?,"Yes. Most people here live on campus. The whole campus is on one little island and there's not much things to do on the island unless you go into the city, which is 30 minutes away. So students get really close to each other and you're probably seven minutes away from any person on this campus.",,"Our campus is located on an island and it's very different from any other university. It's a very tight knit community as we only have over one thousand students of all majors, and since the campus is a bit far from the city, students spend a lot of time together and most of them live on campus.",,,,,
EDU,3,20,TRAIN,What was your favorite class?,My favorite class was probably Negotiation and Consensus Building. It was a class that I took in New York on my study away.,,My favorite courses were Negotiation and Consensus Building in New York and Fundamentals of Acting in Abu Dhabi.,,,,,
EDU,3,21,TRAIN,I see. What was the hardest class for you?,"Oh, the hardest class for me was probably Econometrics because the professors told us that having taken Calculus wasn't a prerequisite for it, which was definitely a lie and I was struggling for the first time in my life at math, because, you know, I've never taken that.",,The hardest class for me was probably Econometrics. I haven't taken Calculus before it and apparently I needed it!,,,,,
EDU,3,22,TRAIN,I know what you're talking about it.,"Exactly. It was also very disheartening because, you know, when you're used to being good at something and suddenly you're not. It's sad.",,Thanks!,,,,,
EDU,3,23,TRAIN,In your university do you have any like clubs and classes outside of your like outside of the curriculum? Like something that students organize and students do?,"Yes we have student led organizations and they're called usually Student Interest Groups, SIGs, and then there's these groups like people promoting their culture. For example the Pakistani Student Association is very very active and organizing a lot of fun things. There's these groups about food, there's this LGBTQ group, you know, that promotes LGBTQ events on campus, and there's groups about interests like chess or Chinese tea or stuff like that. And it's very easy to start something on campus, but because there are so many things going on it's a bit hard to have attendance of people. But every time you say ""free food"" people come to your events.",,"We have Student Interest Groups, they range from cultural clubs, to sports and identities like LGBTQ.",,,,,
EDU,3,24,TRAIN,That's good. So do you have International Student's Day? Where students from all over the country represent their culture and so on?,"No, we don't really have that cause international students day is every day here, because every day you go to eat, you know, for example in the dining hall and there's rarely two people from the same country at that table, so a lot of times you already end up talking about how it is like at home or differences, you know. So it feels redundant.",,We don't really have an International Students Day because every day is International Students Day here.,,,,,
EDU,3,25,TRAIN,"OK, got this. So let's imagine that you have gone back to your freshman year. So what advice would you give to yourself now?","Awww I love this question. So I think I would tell myself that, ""Margarita, you're actually really cool. I know it seems like everyone is way smarter than you here, but there are things you can do that other people can't do and it's just everyone is pretending that they've got it figured out, but no one knows what they're doing and the fact that you don't know what you're doing, but you're still working hard and trying to find yourself is already admirable, so relax"".",,"The advice I'd give my younger self would be, ""No one knows what they're doing and the fact that you're still working hard and trying to find yourself is already admirable, so relax"".",,,,,
EDU,3,26,TRAIN,That's such a nice advice.,Thank you.,,Awww thanks!,Thank you.,Thanks!,,,
EDU,3,27,TRAIN,What else. During your studies what kinds of hidden talents did... have you discovered in yourself?,Okay. Ummm...,,I realized that I can turn my extroverted personality into a job!,,,,,
EDU,3,28,TRAIN,"Or not talents, maybe some like... some things you didn't know about and then you just found out, ""oh... I can do this! Or I'm actually good at doing that!""","So I realized that I can turn my personality into a job. You know, there are so many jobs that require for you to be very client oriented, and I never thought that I could use my communication skills to anything else, but just, you know, normal daily activities. So for example that's why I started... just this year I realized that I should try consulting because, you know, with my econ background or having actually a major in music, in a whole different field, specializing, that gives me extra knowledge and having communication skills is really helpful as a consultant.",BrokenExchange,I realized that I can turn my extroverted personality into a job!,,,,,
EDU,4,1,TRAIN,"OK, first off how would you describe the Abu Dhabi campus?","Our campus is located on an island so it's very different from any other university that I know about. It's a very tight knit community because we only have like a thousand and something student in total, of all majors, and since it's a bit far from the city, students spend a lot of time together so it's a very interesting campus.",,"Our campus is located on an island and it's very different from any other university. It's a very tight knit community as we only have over one thousand students of all majors, and since the campus is a bit far from the city, students spend a lot of time together and most of them live on campus.",,,,,
EDU,4,2,TRAIN,Oh yeah. Do you prefer it over New York since you've been to New York as well?,"I actually love both just as much for different reasons. The campus in New York is so lively and it's too easy to get lost in the crowd and be alone when you want, there's so much happening in New York, there's always activities so it's very fun. But I love the Abu Dhabi campus because since there's not that much to do from the outside we have a lot of time to study and the environment for studying is great and your friends are always very close, you know, location-wise too. So you can hang out very quickly and efficiently.",,"I love all campuses for different reasons. The other two are in the middle of the city and are more lively, but our campus has the best facilities and is less crowded which makes it easier to focus on studying.",,,,,
EDU,4,3,TRAIN,Oh wow. That's amazing.,Yep.,,Yes.,Thank you!,,,,
EDU,4,4,TRAIN,"I'd say like since you've graduated, you had four years of college, which year was your favorite?",I really loved my junior year.,,I'm not sure.,"Maybe it's because it's been so recent, but the graduation was spectacular and my family was here and saying goodbye to friends and all that. I've also loved of course all the study abroad experiences, they have changed me so much.",,,,
EDU,4,5,TRAIN,Was that when you came to New York?,Yes. So half of it was in Abu Dhabi and half of it in New York. And New York is my favorite place in the world and my senior year was really great because of my boyfriend. I got a boyfriend.,,Yes.,,,,,
EDU,4,6,TRAIN,Congrats. Amazing.,Thank you. Yes it was a good year too.,,Thank you!,Thanks!,Thank you.,Thanks.,,
EDU,4,7,TRAIN,"Wow. I'm like a little stuck... Hmm, what can I ask you...","I can also give you hints. That's fine. You can ask me about my major, about my classes, about my professors.",,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,"You can ask me about my favorite food, or my friends, or the sports that I like!",You can ask me about the languages that I speak or my experiences in music.,,,
EDU,4,8,TRAIN,Oh yes. Okay. Talk to me more about your major.,So I majored in music and my minor is in economics.,,"I studied music and economics. I'm a music major, economics minor and in music I do mostly composition and sound engineering.",,,,,
EDU,4,9,TRAIN,"Wow, she's diverse. Yes. Why did you choose that?",So I like music. I chose my music major because I love composition and sound engineering. So it fulfills my creative and my technical side. And I love economics because I love having this understanding of how to make an impact on the world and I love mathematics as well. So that's kind of my social and my analytical side.,,"Music completes this artistic and techie side of me because I studied composition and sound engineering, but economics fulfilled my social and analytical side, because I wanted to learn about how to make an impact in the world and I love math.",,,,,
EDU,4,10,TRAIN,Yeah. Wow. So how do you like envision like kind of using both of your studies in the future?,"So it's kind of crazy. I always thought that I'm going to work in the music industry, but I've had some internship experiences that kind of opened my eyes on how the music industry works. So I never thought too hard of why am I doing multiple things and how am I gonna use both of them. You know, I just love learning and I like to have a plan A and plan B. So right now I'm thinking into going actually to consulting or I'm about to get a job in Tax. Transfer pricing and all that. It's helpful to learn more, I think, more diverse things.",,I don't.,I'm not sure I can do that.,,,,
EDU,4,11,TRAIN,"Sure. And I'm sure that like you can, I don't know, like use your... Like the music industry also needs tech skills. So that's awesome.",Exactly. So you never know where your life will go.,,"Yes, exactly.",Exactly.,,,,
EDU,4,12,TRAIN,"Yeah, for sure. Enjoy your life, hey.",I will.,,Thanks.,,,,,
EDU,4,13,TRAIN,So what would be your favorite class that you've ever taken?,"This is hilarious, cause my favorite class is at NYU Stern.",,My favorite courses were Negotiation and Consensus Building in New York and Fundamentals of Acting in Abu Dhabi.,,,,,

The professor from the negotiation course is pretty amazing, and so is my professor of strategic management.",,,,,
EDU,4,17,TRAIN,Wow that's awesome. How is your like... Compare the academic stress levels between the two campuses?,Oh I love this question! I feel like they're stressful in different ways. The grading is more lenient in New York.,,I think the Abu Dhabi and the Shanghai campuses are more intense in terms of studying compared to the New York campus.,,,,,
EDU,4,18,TRAIN,Really? Wow. That's good to hear.,"Yes. I love it too. And in New York... what's harder in New York is that the classes can be in different buildings so you have to run around. Yeah. There's less facilities in New York as well, so you have to really think ahead and structure that. Here the stress levels come from seeing everybody work all the freaking time because there's nothing else, again, there's not that much to do on this island. You have to go in the city and sometimes it's a lot of effort, you know, people just stay here and you see everyone constantly saying that they're studying and you feel guilty and you want to do more.",,Thanks.,Thanks!,,,,
EDU,4,19,TRAIN,Wow. That's that's strange to hear.,"But also I feel like a lot of students in New York also are struggling with paying for their university, and here on this campus the scholarship is way more generous because it comes from the UAE. Yes it's very generous. That's one of the main reasons why so many talented students go to the Middle East while they've never been before even, you know. So I feel like it's less stress in terms of that, you know, you can focus more on academics here than the poor students who have to think of their financial situation all the time that I've met in New York.",,Yep.,Yes.,,,,
EDU,4,20,TRAIN,"Wait even if you're an international student, do you get a generous financial aid?","Yes, exactly.",,Exactly.,"Yes, exactly.",,,,

EDU,4,22,TRAIN,"Yeah, compared to like here, international students don't get like anything. That's crazy.",Oh really? Anything? Because I know a few students who do.,,(Silent nod),,,,,
EDU,4,23,TRAIN,"It's just cause like a lot of... Well I know a lot of people from international like countries like they just don't need it, so NYU just doesn't give it to them. But I do have friends that like are from Korea and they're not like super rich. So they need financial aid, but then NYU just assumes that like people from Korea like don't need the money. So like this girl got like like, I don't know like, 8K, but like that didn't really help her.",Ok I see. Yes. See this adds to the academic stress.,,Yep.,,,,,
EDU,4,24,TRAIN,Yeah it really sucks. So do you think you're prepared for like the real world after NYU?,I feel I definitely have a better preparation than the average person of my age.,,I feel that I'm definitely more prepared than an average person of my age.,,,,,
EDU,4,25,TRAIN,Oh yeah for sure.,"Yeah. Many students here, actually even on this campus, maybe they wouldn't be so prepared because we're so spoiled and used for everything to be covered and then you go into the real world and nothing is covered and you're by yourself and we're here alone without our families. So we had to learn to be independent. But I feel like even though right now I'm stressed and looking for jobs, I feel like because of my personality of being a go-getter, you know, trying to stay optimistic I think that will help me, and I'll be fine.",,Yep.,,,,,
EDU,4,26,TRAIN,That's awesome.,Thanks.,,Thanks.,Thanks!,,,,
EDU,4,27,TRAIN,How far are you guys from the city?,"We are 30 minutes away with a bus from the city. So it's not that crazy. But you still have to make that effort to coordinate and go there and there's shuttles that come at specific times. A year ago we actually were introduced to a public city bus that now comes to this island as well. So that is very helpful, it comes every hour. Yeah. Before that it was harder. It's not such great transportation like in New York, you just hop on a train. No, there's no metro here.",,We are 30 minutes away from the city center by car or bus.,"Relationships are harder to maintain because of all the study-aways.

Anything.,,"You can ask me about my favorite food, or my friends, or the sports that I like!",You can ask me about the languages that I speak or my experiences in music.,You can ask me about my family or about my passions. Anything you want.,,,
EDU,4,32,TRAIN,Yeah. How's the meal plan?,It's pretty good. We have also university money that you can spend only at the university and you get some money that you can spend anywhere. But it's... I feel like it's quite similar to that from New York. Like if you don't use it was it expires.,,"Many students here are on full scholarship, but all of them have at least partial scholarships.","There are various food options on campus including at the Dining Hall, Market Place, Blacksmith Coffee and Sushi Counter.",,,,
EDU,4,33,TRAIN,That really sucks. It's like a waste of money.,"Yes, but actually funny thing... Because most people here have the same meal plan and there are a few things which are called Meals Swipes and if you don't use them all by the end of the week they expire and you get new ones for the next week. So because everyone has this and some people eat more and some people eat less people just trade them, you know, like they don't treat it like money. They're like, ""You want some? Oh ok, sure I'll feed you, cause mine are gonna expire, I didn't use all of them."" So it's so chill, yeah, seeing people just give each other meal swipes, all the time.",,Yep.,,,,,
EDU,4,34,TRAIN,"That's so funny how it's like week by week versus like here it's like every semester you get like a few, like an amount.",Yeah. We get that too. So it's like half of our things are week by week and half of it is by semester.,,Tell me what else you'd like to know.,,,,,
EDU,4,35,TRAIN,Ahh I got it. So you can choose.,"You can choose which ones to spend, but you get half and half.",,Yep.,,,,,
EDU,4,36,TRAIN,Ahh got it.,"Yeah. So the swipes that expire every week are seen as less valuable to students and they trade very easily. I mean trade... not trade, they just donate.",,Yep.,,,,,

EDU,4,38,TRAIN,Very relevant!,"Exactly. So because the maximum distance between two people on this campus is ten minutes of walk, dating here is really hard because you spend all time together, you see them all the time, you don't get a break. So relationships are sped up on campus. You feel like if you date for a year like you've been dating for three years, you know. People even move in together right away, cause it's so easy. We're like neighbors, well, what's to move in, you know? But with friends it's really great. It's sometimes harsh because most students study away at least once or two times and a lot of times you and your friends are studying abroad at different times so it's very hard.

I expected something good and I was coming here for the scholarship and I was coming here for the good education and I knew that people are very international and open minded and I was good with that.

I came here for the scholarship, but I loved these four years dearly.",,,,,
EDU,5,11,TRAIN,Did you apply anywhere else from this place?,"No. I applied very early to this place. I applied earliest. There are different deadlines, there is early decision one, early decision two, and then the regular decision, so you can apply as early as October, I think, or November, in my senior year in high school. So I found out before January, I already found out that I'm in. So I knew... when I applied I was hoping to get in and I was like, ""if I don't get in then I'll start looking for something else"". But I wanted to wait, because I put all of my effort into this one application.",,NYUAD was my first choice and I didn't even apply to other universities!

I think they liked my personality, and I think they liked that I did a lot of different extracurricular things and that I was combining my scientific predilections and the artistic predilections, you know. It was like ""Oh wow, she likes everything"". But at the same time, I can't take all the credit and I must say that I think me being Moldovan really helped because there's not that many people, right, applying from Moldova. I don't know from the top of my head, I don't know, maybe anywhere from five to 15 people. And they always take between one and three people from Moldova. So I actually knew some very good, amazing, brilliant people who applied from Moldova, and they didn't get in. So I think I also was lucky.

Can you compare it?","Oh my god, the difference is so big. It's crazy. It's crazy. Here I feel professors are very open minded, very chill and they're really good in their craft and this all comes from the budget. This all comes from the fact that, you know, they're paid very well so they can afford to get very good professors. Of course that my teachers in primary school, middle, and high school, they were paid so little. So I guess it's so much easier to hire any teacher in Moldova, right? So now that I look back I understand that many of the teachers in Moldova had no idea what they were doing, neither in their subject nor in the psychology of kids. So they shouldn't be teaching kids. But I had some great teachers in Moldova, but here most of my professors are just brilliant, you know, so it's hard to compare.

So in Ramadan actually there are laws, in this country specifically, that you can't drink or eat in public, so around the city. Which is fine with us, we just put our food in a bag and you just... You can eat in restaurants and all that, but the restaurants are covered, you know, the windows. It has to be inside the restaurant.

Like do students study abroad?,"Yes, actually more students study abroad at least one. There are a lot of campus branches around the world.

I know there are a number of people doing also engineering or computer science, but I think it economics... wuite a lot of people do it.",None,,,,,,
EDU,7,17,TEST,Yeah. So how does the liberal arts education system work? Like what sort of requirements are there for students to get a degree?,"So you basically have to declare your major at the end of the year two. Before that you can experiment and all that, but you have to keep in mind that each major has its own set of classes that you must take, in any order. However, some courses do require prerequisites so you need to be careful about the order and you need to hurry about with taking the prerequisites, and then you can take electives and it can take. There are these things called core classes and you must take a few from each category. So it's quite lenient about when and what you take, but it depends on your major.

I worked for maybe two or three months crafting my application, making sure it's perfect.

EDU,9,2,TEST,Did you want to do this bachelor? Like when did you realize that you wanted to do specifically this bachelor?,"So I wanted to do music my whole life. But at the same time I wasn't sure, because, you know how they say music is not serious, that's not a real career. I don't know, it's risky.

Like music and economics is kind of different somehow, and do you think that in future life you'll be able to combine these two or just work in a specific field?","To be honest I feel like any two random subjects can be combined in some way. But even if they don't get combined in a very clear way, I think that it's not necessary for you to know exactly how you're going to use something. I think it's very useful to just learn as much as possible. Whatever you're passionate of, but also things that make you more diverse and more competitive in this, you know in this market, in this world, that's so interesting with the digital era. So my goal in life is to learn as much as possible from as many things as possible, so maybe right now I'll be joining the corporate world and have jobs there, but maybe in my free time I'll be making music, or maybe in the future I'll be working with the business side of music, you know.",,I'm not sure I can do that.,"Music completes this artistic and techie side of me because I studied composition and sound engineering, but economics fulfilled my social and analytical side, because I wanted to learn about how to make an impact in the world and I love math.",,,,

EDU,9,5,TEST,But was it your first option for university or your you applied to other places?,"Yeah it was my first option and the only university I applied to, because the application deadline was so early.

How many years do you have to study. They have two semesters or more or? Yeah.","Yeah. So you have to study for four years. It's a liberal arts university which means that you can study multiple things and get classes in anything you want, but when you're having a major you have to take some specific classes from that major, right. And then whatever free space you have you can fill it with electives, and you have in a year two semesters and one January term.

So this to me feels like the same thing as before. There are courses that you're worse at, there are courses that you're better at. There are course that if you take a very beginner level you're going to do so well, you know, and there are courses to take like more advanced, of course you're gonna struggle. So it's nothing like oh just because I'm in a different country I'm struggling. Not at all. I feel like it's for people who know English not as well. Maybe they would struggle more.

How's it going?,"To be honest it really depends on the professor, what they feel like, and it depends on what they're teaching, right. Because if it's a math class, then it's very obvious that the professor is going to be writing on the board all the time and speaking to you when you ask questions. There are some lecture based classes in which, you know, you just listen to the lecture and you can ask questions of course. And there are classes in which they really want you to participate.

Most classes range between 10 and 30 students.,,,,
EDU,9,13,TEST,I see. And where do you usually study? In the university's library or at home?,"You could do either. I specifically don't like going to the library often. I don't know, it's depressing for me. I like studying either in my room or going somewhere. There is this one public kitchen, you know like staff kitchen and around where staff work, and I just go and chill there because there's so much light. And also there's this tree, there's one tree, when it wasn't too hot, yes because right now it's like 50 degrees outside, when it wasn't too hot I would go under that tree on a beanbag and study there, it's my favorite tree.",,There is this one tree on campus with lots of shade and birds chirping that other people don't notice for some reason. That's my favorite place!,,,,,
EDU,9,14,TEST,"That's super nice.

I'd give 10.,None,,,,,,
EDU,9,15,TEST,10? That's super nice.,"To be honest of course every university has things to improve. There are some things that aren't perfect, so it's kind of contradictory that I would say 10, but at the same time the most important things I feel like they're working as they're supposed to work, at this university, and the professors are super intelligent, and my classmates are so international, and super smart, and we get to study abroad with this university and you can study almost from any material. To be honest maybe I would give it nine, cause I just remembered that you can study interpreting languages, you can't study law, you can study political science, but not really law, and you can study chemistry, but not really medicine. So kind of those three things are the big ones that are excluded.",None,,,,,,

EDU,9,18,TEST,And you also mentioned that you... Do have to go abroad or is it mandatory to go abroad or is it like it's your choice?,"It's not mandatory to go abroad, especially since you know some people would have to pay out of their pocket. But to be honest, sometimes going abroad would be cheaper. The things here are quite expensive. But, since most students coming here are on a scholarship, it's for free. Yeah. So basically everyone wants to go abroad and get away from the heat for a little bit and see the world.",,NYUAD students can apply to study away at any of NYU's 14 global sites.,,,,,

EDU,9,21,TEST,"Oh really, like the food? Accomodation?","Exactly, I don't have to even think about it. I'm just, you know, using these resources and trying to even save up money from this, not to use up everything and just save up.",,"Everything, literally everything.",,,,,
EDU,9,22,TEST,Oh yeah. What's the grading system there? One till 10?,"Actually it's an American university, so it's the letter grade and the four point scale GPA. And also it's percentages, right. The one to 100 percent and different percentages are different letters.",None,,,,,,
EDU,9,23,TEST,Yeah. And how hard it is to be accepted at this university?,Apparently the acceptance rate is 3 percent.,,It was a very long application and then you had to come here for a candidate weekend and interview and then you would find out if you got in.,"Yes, the acceptance rate is low, so aside from being great you need a little bit of luck.",,,,
EDU,9,24,TEST,Woah!,"Yeah. Yeah. So you need to be great and then you also have to be lucky, because I know a lot of great people who applied, and they didn't get in, and I just feel like there's no reason why I should get in and them not. And of course a big percentage of people who also apply probably aren't that good. So you're not even competing directly with them, but maybe you're competing with the 30 percent who are really good, you know, and you're trying to be in those 3 percent and yeah.",,Yep.,,,,,
EDU,9,25,TEST,But what do you... What's the application procedure?,"So there is this website called the Common Application and with the same common application you can apply to other universities. That's why it's called like that. And you have to submit basically your grades. You have to submit your extracurricular activities, your leadership and volunteering experiences. And also like three essays or something like that. And then the examination scores, either S.A.T., or your national examination or International Baccalaureate. And to be honest they don't look at anything specifically, they look at everything holistically. Like if everything seems great and if you fit in the mission of this university.",,You apply to NYUAD through this website that's called Common Application which you can use to apply to multiple universities at the same time.,"The whole application is very important, they look at it holistically: your grades, extracurriculars, essays, and not one thing is more important than the other.",We have an extensive application that includes details about the students and essays.,"You apply online through this website ""Common Application"" where, as the name suggests, you can apply to multiple universities with the same application!","You apply online, and if they choose you as a candidate they invite you to interview on campus for ""Candidate Weekend"", and they cover all expenses.

EDU,9,26,TEST,I see. And what you think was your asset from your application? Grades or volunteering?,"That's amazing. I've actually had that question asked before. So somebody asked me, ""Why do you think they chose you"". And I thought, aside from luck which played a big part, I think they liked my personality. I am optimistic, I think, and I am very dreamy, you know, I have big dreams and. I am from the application you can see that I'm ambitious, my grades are quite good and I've been to the US as well for an exchange year, I think that's very important, they like to see some element of internationa. l and I also stressed us speaking four language at home and being super, you know, different and diverse, so I know they like diversity as well. So again, I was lucky that I'm Moldovan, right, because they want more people from different countries.",,"Aside from luck, I think I got in because of my warm personality, good grades, previous exchange year in the US, recommendation letters and the diversity that comes with me being Moldovan and speaking 5 languages.",,,,,
EDU,10,1,TEST,How many students are there in NYU Abu Dhabi?,"In total there are around a thousand three hundred students, I think, and probably around three hundred per class.",,"Our campus is located on an island and it's very different from any other university.

EDU,10,2,TEST,And where do the students come from?,Oh the students here are from all over the world. Maybe 15 percent are Emirati. But everyone else is very international.,,"Probably only 15 percent are Emirati students, and everyone else is from around the world.",,,,,
EDU,10,3,TEST,How is the core curriculum like at NYU Abu Dhabi?,"So the core curriculum has, I think, now about six classes.

EDU,10,14,TEST,Who's getting married at a wedding?,"Well it's a mock wedding. So there's two people and they pretend that they're getting married, but it's all, you know, just to kind of imitate the choreography and everything that happens during a wedding.",None,,,,,,

EDU,10,16,TEST,Cool. And can you tell me a typical day in your life?,"Sure. So I just graduated a few weeks ago, but when I was still studying here every day would be different. But at some point during the day I would go to classes, and the classes can be at any time of the day, almost. At some point I would be hanging out with my friends. Sometimes I would be also working as a resident assistant. So you can't truly describe one day here specifically from morning to night because all days are different.",,"I like to go to the mall, eat out or hang at the beach with my friends.",I graduated in May 2019.,,,,
EDU,10,17,TEST,What are some things that people have misconceptions about NYU Abu Dhabi?,"So some people think that NYU Abu Dhabi is built in that country that's not very ethical and that has a problematic history. But to be honest the same can be told about the U.S. that it has a very problematic history and present as well. It's just, you know, people have this misconception that Middle East has wars, but I feel like all countries have big major flaws, but in different areas.",,"A myth is that as a woman you have to be covered completely and wear hijab. Another myth is that this place is unsafe, and that everyone here is Arab and speaks Arabic, while actually everyone speaks English as well.",,,,,
EDU,10,18,TEST,So they should go to NYU Abu Dhabi with an open mind.,"Of course, because you come here for the education, you know, not for I don't know... I can't explain because this university also has so many international students and such great opportunities that they're literally teaching us how to fight injustices in the future and how to make the world a better place. So it would be ironic not to come here because you want the world to be a better place, because that's the reason you come to this university, you know, to experience all these cultures, understand different ways of thoughts, and learn how to implement changes.",,"Yes, exactly.",Exactly.,,,,
EDU,10,19,TEST,And what are some tips or advice you would give to any students who are visiting NYU Abu Dhabi?,The students who want to apply or students who are visiting friends or...?,,"You are free to wear the same clothes that you would wear at home, but it's respectful to cover your knees and shoulders.","You can go to the beach, bars or visit the Louvre museum!",,,,
EDU,10,20,TEST,"Who are visiting. Like, on an exchange in Abu Dhabi?","I would say that there are not that many rules, especially on campus. It's like any international place. You see people of all colors, dressed in all the different types of clothes, acting in different ways. So maybe outside of campus you need to be more aware of the local culture and maybe dress a little bit more modestly if you don't want to attract too much attention, because it's not so much a thing of a law as much as a thing of staring, you know, it gets really irritating, if you dress differently and everyone is just staring all the time.",BrokenExchange,"You can go to the beach, bars or visit the Louvre museum!",,,,,
EDU,10,21,TEST,And what's the best way to explore Abu Dhabi while we're at the campus?,In which way? The means of transportation or the things to do?,,"You can go to the beach, bars or visit the Louvre museum!","Our students use NYUAD provided shuttles, taxis or the city bus.",,,,
EDU,10,22,TEST,Both.,"So here the taxi system is very well developed. The bus system is kind of OK, it's not too crazy. And you could bike, potentially, but the roads are quite dangerous, so I'd say taxi is the best way. The places that you can see here... there's the Grand Mosque that is very famous and very beautiful. There's the Corniche, you can take a walk on the Corniche, or you can also go in the city and explore different food places, and definitely going to the beach.",,"You can go to the beach, bars or visit the Louvre museum!","Our students use NYUAD provided shuttles, taxis or the city bus.",,,,
EDU,10,23,TEST,Wow. Cool. And how to... how can like students warm up to a new city as quickly as possible?,"It's not that hard to adapt to Abu Dhabi, because the campus itself is a bubble in its own and it's on an island 30 minutes away. So basically whatever you do on this campus is kind of like a different world on its own. Once you go into the city, the ways to adapt is by... even though it's really hot outside, there's very strong and cold a air conditioner everywhere. So you might want to actually wear jeans and a sweater even though you're burning outside. Because otherwise you'll freeze inside, and do it so that you just like see what people do and just be as respectful as you can in your best way. There's not very many explicit rules. And maybe less public display of affection and definitely no drinking in public.",,"You are free to wear the same clothes that you would wear at home, but it's respectful to cover your knees and shoulders.",Abu Dhabi is one of the safest cities in the world.,,,,

EDU,10,26,TEST,And where's the best place to eat on campus?,"The most popular place I guess is the dining hall. Because we also get meal plans and part of it you can only use in the dining hall, but also there are like little food places, like it's called the Market Place and then there's another one The Sushi Counter on campus. Some of them takes University credit if you want, like the money the university gives you, but for some of it you need to pay real cash. So it depends.",,"There are various food options on campus including at the Dining Hall, Market Place, Blacksmith Coffee and Sushi Counter.",,,,,

EDU,10,29,TEST,Can you tell me the craziest thing you have done in your four years at NYU Abu Dhabi?,"I don't think I can tell you the craziest thing that I've done, I think I need to keep that to myself. But I guess one of the crazy things that I've done is I climbed a mountain in its off season when I didn't know, and there was so much snow and we were definitely not prepared for it, that we could have died. But we were very resilient and we were ignorant of how dangerous the situation we were in actually was. So we were fine because of that.",,"I've been to Buenos Aires and New York for a semester each and I've done two January terms, in Shanghai and Paris.",,,,,

You make friends and people here are very interesting, so you'll find someone interested in that. Or you can just write in the Facebook group of this university, for students, just say, ""hey guys, I want to do this, anyone wants to be on board?"" and then so many people usually reply. People are very open to doing things together even though you don't know each other.",,"We have Student Interest Groups, they range from cultural clubs, to sports and identities like LGBTQ.",,,,,
EDU,10,31,TEST,What's a best class you have taken at NYU Abu Dhabi,The best class that I've taken is probably Negotiation at Stern.,,My favorite courses were Negotiation and Consensus Building in New York and Fundamentals of Acting in Abu Dhabi.,,,,,
EDU,10,32,TEST,Cool. Why is it the best?,"Because the learning curve was so steep and the skills were immediately applicable in my life, in my daily life, and I use it until now. So it's something that you can only build upon, it's not something you lose and it has immediate benefits.",,Negotiation and Consensus Building teaches how to protect your interests when you negotiate with somebody while still building relationships.
